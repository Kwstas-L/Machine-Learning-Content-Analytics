      "Concordance Between Different Amyloid Immunoassays and Visual Amyloid Positron Emission Tomographic Assessment",
      "Third, we used a validated MSD electrochemiluminescence multiplex assay to detect plasma A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 concentrations, which exhibits several advantages compared with traditional ELISAs, such as simultaneous processing of plasma A\u03b2 species and more efficiently detecting plasma A\u03b2 [41, 42].\nMeanwhile, concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b2measured by theMSD immunoassay have been reported to be strongly correlated with the antibody-independent mass spectrometry-based reference measurement procedure [43].\nThere are also several limitations to our study that should be acknowledged.",
      "Recently, fully automated immunoassay platforms for assessing CSF AD core biomarkers have been developed to reduce variability, costs and waiting times [17,18].\nThese platforms seem to have a good concordance with classical manual ELISAs and visual amyloid positron emission tomographic assessment [19], but more studies are needed to assess their diagnostic performance in clinical routine.\nIn this study we sought to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a fully-automated chemiluminescent platform (LUMIPULSE G600-II, Fujirebio Europe, Ghent, Belgium) in routine diagnostics of AD as compared to classical manual ELISAs.",
      "In spite of all these challenges, there has been considerable progress in the field.\nUltrasensitive high-precision assays that allow for the accurate determination of a ratio of 42 to 40 amino acid-long amyloid b (Ab42/Ab40) can now detect cerebral b-amyloidosis (determined by amyloid PET) with 70\u201390% diagnostic accuracy [7\u201311], which is almost as good as the corresponding CSF test [12].\nSerum or plasma neurofilament light (NfL) is emerging as a reliable biomarker for neurodegeneration and neuronal injury, irrespective of underlying cause [13].",
      "CSF from 1291 subjects were included in these analyses.\nUsing an established threshold of the CSF A\u03b242/t-tau ratio for \u03b2-amyloid pathology (Janelidze et al., 2017), 707 were classified as negative, and 584 were classified as positive (Table 1).\nSubjects were additional stratified by clinical classification into CN (463 A\u03b242/t-tau negative, 151 positive), SCD (140 A\u03b242/t-tau negative, 70 positive), MCI (104 A\u03b242/t-tau negative, 177 positive) and AD (186 A\u03b242/t-tau positive).",
      "BACE1 levels have been shown to correlate with markers of neuronal degradation and neurofibrillary tangles (total and phosphorylated tau) [20], as well as synaptic loss (neurogranin), but notwithAb [21], suggesting a relationship to neurodegeneration.\nAssociated biomarkers can be explored as ratios, which, in some cases, have shown to offer better diagnostic performance, for example, the CSF Ab1\u201342/Ab1\u201340 ratio [22].\nRecently, we compared several CSF measures as single analytes and ratios to cognitive decline and found that an increased ratio betweenCSF neurogranin trunc P75 and BACE1 (Ng/BACE1) was the only robust correlate of cognitive decline in MCI cases due to AD [21].",
      "In particular, the lack of normative value deserves a special attention when considering A\u03b2 findings, because there is no universal cutoff value to define the abnormal CSF A\u03b21-42 level.\nIndeed, the A\u03b21-42 CSF dosage may be affected by preanalytical and analytical variability (33).\nTo counteract this limit, we adopted as cutoff a limit value (i.e.",
      "Thus, the intensity of the light emitted corresponds to the amount of the biomolecule present in the biological sample.\nInterestingly, comparison of this approach with ELISAs of various providers (IBL International, Fujirebio-Europe, Euroimmun) for Ab1\u201342 quantification in the CSF showed that absolute values obtained differed among all the techniques, but that the data sets were highly correlated [23].\nThe MSDVR technology has greater sensitivity, a broader dynamic range and lower background than classical chemiluminescence approaches [23], and should allow quantification of Ab peptide in other fluids such as plasma.",
      "By normalizing to the concentration of Ab40, the most abundant in the CSF, the ratio normalizes the differences in overall Ab concentration, providing a better index of Ab-related pathology.\nRecently, several studies reported that adding the CSF Ab42/Ab40 ratio to diagnostic tools might: (a) improve prediction accuracy of amyloid plaque burden in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), (b) improve discrimination of AD from other forms of dementia, and (c) increase the concordance between CSF and PET amyloidosis (7, 13, 17).\nWe developed an LC\u2013MS/MS method for Ab42 analysis in CSF (18).",
      "Concentrations of Ab42 obtained by the modified method correlate very well with results obtained using both the reference method for Ab42 alone (slope 0.999, r2 \u00bc 0.\n96), and Elecsys b-amyloid (1-42) immunoassay (29) (slope 0.\n913, r2 \u00bc 0.92).",

      "This suggests that neither orographic interactions (dynamics) nor land-sea contrasts (thermodynamics) are simulated particularly well in WRF even with a 20 km grid spacing.\nSome effort has been put into parameterization of low-level orographic blocking and gravity wave drag in climate models, and this can reduce biases (Pithan et al.\u00a02016; van Niekerk et al.\u00a02016).\nHowever, in the WRF version used here (version 3.8.1), the combined low-level drag and gravity wave parametrization scheme (Shin et al.",

      "(2016) showed that the partitioning of the parametrized orographic drag between the TOFD and the low-level blocking drag has a large impact on the model evolution on timescales from days to seasons.\nOn longer climate timescales, the parametrized orographic drag associated with low-level blocking has been shown to affect both the model fidelity and circulation response to climate change (Pithan et al., 2016; van Niekerk et al., 2017).\nIdealized numerical simulations (e.g., Carissimo et al., 1988; Kim & Arakawa, 1995) and laboratory tank experiments (see Boyer & Davies, 2000, for a review) have lead to improvements in orographic drag parametrizations.",
      "James and Gray (1986) described the barotropic governor effect, by which strong horizontal, barotropic shears made possible by low surface drag act to suppress baroclinicity, resulting in the seemingly paradox behavior of lower surface drag leading to weaker baroclinic activity.\nHowever, sensitivity experiments with complex climate models suggest that adding localized low-level drag over topography acts to shift the Southern Hemisphere jet poleward (Pithan et al., 2016; van Niekerk et al., 2017).\nAquaplanet experiments have shown that changing the surface turbulent fluxes over ocean mostly impacts the midlatitude jet through heat and moisture rather than momentum fluxes (Polichtchouk & Shepherd, 2016).",
      "If only the change in the latitude of the jet maximum is taken into account, both the linear setup with topography and the quadratic drag case without topography show an equatorward shift for stronger drag values, similar to results for Rayleigh drag without topography (Chen et al., 2007).\nThe poleward shift of the jet in response to stronger drag over land in the quadratic drag setup with topography conforms with sensitivity experiments using full-physics climate models that also show a poleward shift of the jet in response to increased orographic drag (Pithan et al., 2016; van Niekerk et al., 2017).\nThe opposite responses of the jet latitude to increases in drag over land and ocean (in the presence of topography and using quadratic drag) might be due to stationary wave dynamics or the latitudinal localization of drag.",
      "A model with quadratic drag and no topography also responds with an equatorward jet shift when drag is increased over real-world land areas only (Mbengue & Woollings, 2019).\nIn our setup with topography and quadratic drag, increased drag over land leads to a poleward shift of the jet, as does increased orographic drag in complex climate models (Pithan et al., 2016; van Niekerk et al., 2017).\nWhile Held-Suarez models have been reported to display a fluctuation-dissipation relationship between jet latitude variability in a control run and the jet latitude shift in response to forcing, no such relationship is PITHAN AND POLICHTCHOUK 8 of 10 found in our model with topography and quadratic drag.",

      "Boer and coworkers recently showed that, when patient-related outcomes, such as physical functioning and restrictions at work are considered, ACPAnegative patients fare as poorly or poorer than ACPA-positive counterparts, which have been shown to have a more severely progressive disease [18].\nThis implies that the effort to further improve the course of the disease should be proportional in all RA patients [19].\nEvidence accumulated over the past decade suggests that there are two main anchors of successful RA management: early detection and intensive therapeutic approaches.",
      "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic auto-immune disease principally affecting synovial joints.\nRA is characterized by immune cell infiltration in the joint [1,2].\nAround 0.5\u20131% of the world population is affected [1,3].",

      "Few, however, have evaluated the economic burden of the disease in relation to ACPA status.\nIn a longitudinal study, Boer et al evaluated outcome in ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative patients, using self-reported impairments, including functional disability and restrictions at work as outcomes, and found no differences in disease burden between ACPApositive and ACPA-negative patients (11).\nMennini et al developed a model estimating annual costs for ACPApositive patients (12) and Shafrin et al reported that ACPA-positive patients had higher direct costs compared to ACPA-negative patients during the first year after diagnosis (13).",
      "At the timepoint of diagnosis, disease activity was even slightly worse in ACPA-negative patients, with worse DAS28 and worse CRP levels compared to ACPA-positive patients.\nThis discrepancy has, however, also been reported by others and is likely to depend on differences in diagnostic criteria according to inclusion by 1987 or 2010 criteria (11, 24).\nIn the present study, patients were included according to the 1987 revised ACR criteria (14).",
      "Costs for healthcare and costs for loss of productivity were similar in the ACPA groups at 3 year follow-up.\nThese findings are in line with a study from the Netherlands, where Boer et al analysed self-reported impairments, including functional disability and restrictions at work, over 4 years in ACPA-positive and ACPAnegative patients, and showed that outcome in ACPApositive RA was not more severe than in ACPA-negative RA (11).\nBy contrast, Shafrin et al found, in a 1 year follow-up, that ACPA-positive patients had significantly higher costs and the difference by ACPA status was mostly driven by the costs of higher use of cDMARDs and biologics in ACPA-positive patients (13).",
      "Hence, close radiographic monitoring is warranted in early anti-CCP-positive RA regardless of disease activity.\nThe management of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has improved substantially in recent decades thanks to treat-to -target strategies and novel pharmaceutical options (1, 2).\nMajor breakthroughs were made in the late 1990s with the identification of citrulline residues as key antigenic determinants for RA-specific autoantibodies (3, 4) and the development of easily available detection assays, such as the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) test.",
      "Keywords: rheumatoid arthritis, autoantibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, remission Our knowledge on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has dramatically increased over the past 2 decades.\nRecognition that RA starts early and key processes of damage even develop before clinically apparent arthritis have fuelled the processes of early diagnosis and prompt treatment institution within the window of opportunity (1, 2).\nIn parallel, better understanding of disease pathogenesis has helped developing new targeted therapeutics that allow good control of signs and symptoms and improve the overall outcomes of the disease (3).",
      "\nProbably, a treat-to-target approach has caused most patients to achieve good treatment outcomes over time, as has been previously shown, but patients who were erosions and ACPA negative seemed to require less treatment changes to achieve those outcomes (23).\nMore research would be required to investigate whether this is due to a better initial treatment response of ACPA negative/erosions negative patients, or a reflection of different treatment decisions of rheumatologists in the absence of ACPA and/or erosions or even differences in the adverse event rate in double-negative patients."

      "Human versus Robots in the Discovery and Crystallization of Gigantic Polyoxometalates",
      "Active Learning tackles the problem of selecting samples from unlabeled sets to be annotated by an oracle.\nIn the last decade, several active learning strategies have been proposed [27,42,63] and applied to several research fields, including speech recognition [32], natural language processing [62], chemistry [18], just to name a few.\nWe refer the reader to the survey of Settles [55] for an extensive review of active learning methods.",
      "This notion can be formalized through mathematical formulations of predictive uncertainty.\nCommonly, predictive uncertainty is quantified from the predictive variance across an ensemble of models [5,6,23,31] or through a distance measure to a decision boundary [22,32].\nAn opportunity exists to derive more complex formulations of utility for an experiment, for example by directly considering the predictive architecture of the model [2].",
      "If active learning reaches a similar acceptance and becomes easily accessible through innovative software solutions [46,47], it might provide a competitive option for optimizing chemistry on complex and high-dimensional response surfaces.\nA small number of studies have compared performance of active learning campaigns to human optimizations and have found that active learning not only outcompetes the queried experts but also performed optimizations in a more systematic and explorative manner [19,32].\nWhile the number of queried human experts in these studies is yet too small to draw definite conclusions, the consistently observed benefit of active learning in independent studies is promising.",
      "More realizations of selfdriving laboratories quickly followed (e.g., the production of Bose\u2013Einstein condensates, where experimental conditions are suggested by a Gaussian process [46]).\nOther examples include the crystallization of polyoxometalate clusters [47], the discovery of NiTi-based shape memory alloys [48], and the discovery of chemical reactions [49,50].\nWhile the aforementioned studies present full implementations of self-driving laboratories, other studies focused on algorithmic developments for experiment planning, and define algorithmic goals [51] or propose strategies to search for ideal conditions [39\u201341].",
      "Specifically, it was shown that algorithm-based search covered approximately nine times more crystallization space than a random search and approximately six times more than human-based discovery.\nPerhaps even more importantly is that the rate of successful crystallization also increased by ~5% [21].\nIn addition, the algorithm explored a wider range of space that would need to be performed either by human or purely random search.",

      "The mortality of Child-Pugh class C patients was significantly reduced in patients receiving preemptive TIPS.\nThus, the authors concluded that preemptive TIPS must be the treatment of choice in Child-Pugh class C patients with acute variceal bleeding (1).\nActually, this conclusion warrants further clarification.",
      "In such patients, preemptive TIPS performed within 72\u00a0h of the PHB leads to a significant reduction of treatment failure, re-bleeding, and mortality rate [3].\nThe improved outcome due to the use of early TIPS in high-risk patients has been confirmed by two recently published cohort studies [24, 25].\nAccording to these results, both the Baveno VI recommendations and the current UK guidelines suggest considering early preemptive insertion of TIPS in patients with Child\u2013Pugh class C (score of 10\u201313) or in Child\u2013Pugh class B with active bleeding [23, 26].",
      "[14]), thus supporting the idea that SSM is a reliable surrogate of PH also able to identify PH variations after NSBB administration.\nMoreover, several other studies support the use of SSM for monitoring PH variations in other settings, such as after trans-jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt positioning whose variations are not correctly caught by LSM [24, 25].\nFinally, the aforementioned advantages related to the use of the SSM could be helpful in the new therapeutic scenario that is emerging following the randomized controlled trial PREDESCI [26].",
      "The role of p-TIPS CTP B + AB patients has been challenged (65) due to the limited number of patients included in the studies and the differential effect of p-TIPS on survival.\nDetailed information regarding CTP B + AB patients was available in two observational studies (71,74) and one RCT (68).\nSurvival was significantly improved in the largest observational study available, including 244 CTP B + AB patients (53 treated with TIPS) from 73 to 91% at 1 year.",
      "However, even when using the current standard of care (NSBB plus EVL) as comparator, the 1-year probability of failure to control bleeding or rebleeding (ARR: 47%), and most importantly, mortality at 1 year (ARR: 25%) were substantially decreased with TIPS.\nThese excellent outcomes in patients with preemptive TIPS have been confirmed by five (but not all) subsequent observational studies, four of them (39-42) using comparable clinical high-risk and exclusion criteria as the European multicenter RCT.\nThe fifth and most recent observational study was a Chinese single center analysis mostly including patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis B who were subjected to antiviral therapy (43).",
      "In summary, there is evidence from 3 RCT (including 2 RCT with a state-of-the-art comparator) demonstrating that preemptive TIPS placement improves survival in high-risk patients (Table 1), thus providing a strong rationale for its application in clinical practice.\nThis is supported by most (40-43), but not all (39, 45) observational studies.\nOf note, the observational studies not reporting a survival benefit had limited sample size (39) or used non-contemporaneous controls (45).",
      "Although preemptive TIPS has already been recommended in the Baveno V consensus published in 2010 (48), a prospective French survey conducted from 4/2012 to 5/2013 revealed that only 7% of eligible patients underwent preemptive TIPS, despite good outcomes under real-world conditions (41).\nSimilarly, in a large prospective observational multicenter study that recruited patients from high-volume centers between 2011 and 2015 (42), preemptive TIPS was placed in only 13% of high-risk patients.\nThese figures indicate a substantial underutilization of preemptive TIPS in clinical practice.",
      "Moreover, surgical shunts may prevent considering a later liver transplantation [5] and are associated with a higher morbidity and mortality than TIPSS [6, 7], explaining why TIPSS is the first-class therapeutic for refractory variceal bleeding.\nUnfortunately, this procedure may cause severe complications, such as left-sided heart failure, right-sided heart failure for undiagnosed portopulmonary hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), and liver failure [6, 8].\nThe occurrence of such complications is significantly associated with death.",
      "\nI read with great interest the manuscript published by Procopet B et al (1).\nThe authors have eloquently demonstrated the survival benefit of pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (p-TIPS) placement in patients with Child C cirrhosis presenting with acute variceal bleed (AVB).",
      "\nResults from the largest prospective study of early TIPS were recently reported by Hern\u00e1ndez-Gea and colleagues (21).\nIn this cohort of 671 patients (high-risk as defined by Garc\u0131\u0301a-Pag\u00e1n and colleagues(17)) from 34 centers, early TIPS reduced the 1-year probability of treatment failure and rebleeding compared with standard drug and endoscopy therapy (92% vs 74%; P 5 ."

      "It has been previously reported that the severity of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) correlates with PGC-1\u03b1 levels in the kidney, and accordingly, lack of PGC-1\u03b1 causes persistent kidney injury following endotoxemia [128].\nIn fact under the basal condition, PGC1\u03b1 KO mice display spontaneous subclinical kidney injury characterized by tubulointerstitial inflammation and exhibit a higher mortality rate than their wild-type (WT) littermates after AKI induction [129].\nIn addition, the expression of PGC-1\u03b1 diminishes in aging muscle and has been associated with systemic inflammation in mice [130].",
      "After LPS/TNF\u03b1 injection, the overexpression of PGC-1\u03b1 in skeletal muscle does not suppress proinflammatory cytokine expression but lowers M1 cytokine IL-12 levels and enhances the production of anti-inflammatory M2 cytokines [142].\nIn addition, PGC1\u03b1 KO mice exhibit increased M1 and decreased M2 responses in the kidney after AKI induction [129].\nAlthough the molecular mechanisms regulating macrophages polarization are poorly understood, these cells have been reported to be metabolically reprogrammed during polarization [143].",
      "Renal inflammation also plays a central role in the initiation and progression of CKD by causing fibrosis [31].\nThere are many reports that PGC-1\u03b1 has an anti-inflammatory effect [32,33].\nTherefore, it is necessary to investigate whether the inhibition of progression to EMT by TGF-\u03b2 treatment in PGC-1\u03b1 cells is an indirect effect of inflammation modulation.",
      "\nSimilarly, PGC-1\u03b1 is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in the kidney(16); its activation downregulates mitochondriamediated oxidative stress and profibrotic pathways(35,36); whereas suppression of PGC-1\u03b1 promotes renal inflammation (37).\nActivation of FGF21mitigates the injurious effects of reactive oxygen species, inflammation and fibrosis in the kidney.",

      "However, a wealth of evidence suggests that a dysfunctional proteostasis in NDs related to both aging and the inhibitory effect of misfolded protein aggregates may cause an accumulation of ubiquitin in the brain [5,8,9].\nMoreover, ubiquitin can be released by dying cells, thereby increasing its level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a consequence of neuronal damage [4,5,10].\nWe have developed a very selective and precise liquid chromatography\u2212multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC\u2212MS/MS) method for the measurement of CSF free monoubiquitin and already reported a significant increase in protein levels in Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD) and AD, in line with other studies investigating the same or other ubiquitin forms [3\u20136,9,11].",

      "Bifidobacteriaceae were more abundant in the propolis group and have been previously shown to be important to maintaining colony health [17,26,35,37,39].\nBartonella is a gut symbiont [40] that has been shown to differ seasonally [41] and in honey bees exposed to various types of landscapes [34], raising the question of its functional roles and how propolis may interact with it.\nOther significant taxa identified in the study, such as Enterobacteriaceae, are facultative anaerobes that are suggested to be involved in metabolic processes such as including sugar and nitrogen processing [41].",

      "[21] found that, on average, the insect gut bacterial microbiota was dominated by 62.1% Proteobacteria and 20.7% Firmicutes.\nApproximately one billion bacterial cells reside in the gut of mature honeybee workers, and \u223c95% are in the hindgut [8].\n3.3.",

      "Indeed, these findings indicate that circulating endotrophin may be a useful additional indicator for the diagnosis of diabetes.\nIn the present study, however, the most relevant observation relates to the fact that plasma endotrophin (most likely deriving from adipose tissue) can serve as a predictive biomarker for the response of diabetic individuals to TZD exposure [26].\nIn the upper two tertiles of endotrophin levels, the authors observe a more drastic reduction in fasting glucose and HbA1c levels after TZD exposure than in individuals within the lowest tertile.",
      "This suggests that individuals with circulating endotrophin levels higher than 6.3 ng/ml are more responsive to TZDs (at least for the two compounds used here, pioglitazone and balaglitazone), while patients whose plasma endotrophin level is relatively lower at baseline do not respond well to these TZDs and may be better candidates for other glucose-lowering agents.\nIn addition, in terms of adverse effects of the glitazone-based compounds, the incidence rate of peripheral oedema (considered a severe adverse effect [SAE]) was also related to endotrophin tertiles [26].\nThus endotrophin levels may serve as predictive indicators of at least some of the side effects of TZDs.",
      "We linked naturally with its anti-inflammation and activation of PPAR\u03b3.\nAs a member of nuclear receptor super-family, PPAR\u03b3 participates in regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism [27].\nMoreover, PPAR\u03b3 also plays important roles in enhancing insulin sensitivity, promoting lipogenesis and anti-inflammatory as well.",
      "Therefore, whole-body energy and metabolic homeostasis depend significantly on adipose tissue function [3,5].\nAdipocytes and their precursor cells (pre-adipocytes) are enclosed by a flexible extracellular matrix (ECM) that support them mechanically and allow them to expand and respond to biochemical signaling molecules [6].\nCollagen type VI (Col6) is one of the most important ECM proteins and consists of three discrete \u03b1 subunits including Col6\u03b11, Col6\u03b12 and Col6\u03b13 chains [3,6,7].",
      "Adipose tissue is the source of various adipocytokines that are mostly increased in obesity [14].\nOn the other hand, ECM accumulation and white adipose tissue fibrosis that occurs in obesity, cause reduced flexibility which leads to adipocyte dysfunction and cytokine production [6,15,16].\nVisfatin, initially identified as a pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor (PBEF), is one of the major adipocytokines and pro-inflammatory molecules that is mainly secreted from macrophages that are infiltrated in visceral adipose tissue [17,18].",
      "Type VI collagen is a triple-helix molecule composed of A1, A2 and A3 polypeptide chains secreted from connective tissue, especially from adipose tissue [7].\nEndotrophin is a newly identified adipokine that is a soluble proteolytic fragment of the A3 chain of type VI collagen [6].\nEndotrophin also stimulates transforming growth factorbeta 1 (TGF-B1) production, adipose tissue fibrosis, and increases insulin resistance [7].",
      "From a biomarker perspective serum PRO-C6 has been found associated with chronic and diabetic kidney disease [47,48].\nLikewise, in type 2 diabetic patients PRO-C6 was found to predict response to a PPAR agonist treatment [49].\nPRO-C6 has also shown prognostic value in COPD [42].",
      "Interestingly, the carboxyterminal 221 propeptide of the alpha3 chain of type VI procollagen (Endotrophin), a marker of type VI collagen 222 formation, has recently been shown to be associated with adipose tissue inflammation and fibrosis, and the 223 severity of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD (30, 224 31, 43).\nEndotrophin predicts the response of HbA1c serum levels to insulin sensitizers (PPAR\u03b3 agonists) 225 (12) and predicts the progression of kidney fibrosis (6).\nThese characteristics indicate that type VI (pro-226 )collagen is an ECM constituent with particular pathophysiological relevance, driving not only fibrotic 227 remodelling, but also metabolic derangement, a hallmark of NASH.",
      "\nIn this issue of Diabetologia, Karsdal and colleagues [26] provide a novel clinical assay in which they measure circulating endotrophin, a C-terminal cleavage fragment generated from the \u03b13 chain of collagen VI.\nTo date, very little is known about critical markers that may be available to identify drug response rates to TZDs.",
      "Specifically, the relationship between the response to TZDs and the level of ECM components is not well understood.\nIn the present study [26], the authors divided participants into tertiles based on plasma endotrophin levels.\n"

      "The SLC22A family comprises (1) organic cation transporters (OCTs), like the uptake transporters OCT1 (SLC22A1), expressed at the sinusoidal pole of hepatocytes, and OCT2 (SLC22A2) [30], present on the basolateral pole of renal proximal tubule cells, respectively; (2) organic anion transporters (OATs), such as the renal OAT1 (SLC22A6), OAT3 (SLC22A8) and OAT4 (SLC22A11), and the sinusoidal hepatic OAT2 (SLC22A7) [31]; and (3) organic cation/carnitine transporter (also known as organic cation transporter novel) (OCTN) 1 (SLC22A4) and OCTN2 (SLC22A5), sharing numerous substrates with OCTs [32].\nThe SLC47A family corresponds to multidrug and toxin extrusion transporters (MATEs) present at the apical pole of hepatocytes (MATE1/SLC47A1) and renal proximal tubule cells (MATE1 and MATE2-K/SLC47A2), where they act as H+/organic cation antiporters for putatively secreting drugs into bile or urine [33].\nAdditional main SLC transporters handling drugs correspond to the hepatic sodium-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP/SLC10A1), that can mediate statin transport [34], and proton-coupled peptide transporters (PEPTs/SLC15A) PEPT1 (SLC15A1) and PEPT2 (SLC15A2) [35], notably located in intestine and kidney, respectively, as well as nucleoside transporter proteins [36].",
      "MATE1 is involved in the luminal excretion of organic compounds from cells that have been, for example, imported by basolateral expressed organic cation transporters.\nIt has been shown that MATE1 can transport a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous substrates (reviewed in [23]).\nMATE1 is also able to transport cisplatin and to a higher content, oxaliplatin [24].",
      "This would prevent accumulation of these drugs, for example in the cells of proximal tubulus, and thereby reduce the nephrotoxic effect of these compounds.\nOn the other hand, reduced MATE1 would have the opposite effect [23].\nIt has also been shown that MATE1 expression is associated with better uptake of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia cells [25].",
      "It is conceivable that pathways exist that can regulate renal secretion of organic cations acting both on hOCTs and hMATEs.\nThe present knowledge on MATE regulation is well summarized in [37].\nTranscriptional regulation of MATE1 has been described, together with regulation of its function or mRNA expression under pathological situations such as ischemia/reperfusion injury and diabetes [37]."

      "Simulations at kilometric resolutions using isotropic, plastic rheologies have been shown to generate linear kinematic features, such as leads and ridges, which look realistic, although are not well resolved and may not be oriented correctly [125].\nFurthermore, being at the interface between the two, sea ice responds strongly to the forcing provided by the atmosphere and ocean components within climate models [126].\nThis means that changes in model resolution that lead to improvements in the mean state (i.e.",
      "There is a clear improvement in many of these regional biases, particularly in the stratocumulus regions where typical biases found in the high-resolution models of HighResMIP are below 1\u00b0C compared to up to 3-4\u00b0C found in the multi-model mean of the low-resolution models of HighResMIP [M J Roberts et al., 2019].\nImprovements can be seen in the upwelling regions off the west coasts of South America and Africa and also over the northern Atlantic [Caldwell et al., 2019; Docquier et al., 2019].\nThe cold bias along the equator in the Pacific Ocean with too cold SSTs extending too far west [Lauer et al., 2018], disappeared in the high resolution versions [C D Roberts et al., 2018; M J Roberts et al., 2019].",
      "Models participating in the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP; Haarsma et al., 2016) indicate that the horizontal resolution is important to correctly represent both Arctic sea ice and Atlantic OHT.\nIn particular, the total Arctic sea-ice area and volume decrease and Atlantic OHT increases with increasing ocean resolution, suggesting a strong link between sea ice and OHT (Docquier et al., 2019).\nThe suggested mechanism is that at higher ocean resolution, the boundary currents become stronger and warmer (Roberts et al., 2016; Grist et al., 2018), leading to larger OHT, which reduces the sea-ice cover.",
      "All the other model configurations present a realistic spatial distribution of sea-ice concentration compared to observations (Figure 1).\nA previous study using five out of the seven models used here showed that a higher ocean resolution leads to lower total Arctic sea-ice area during all months, except for a slight increase in sea-ice area for AWI-CM in winter (Docquier et al., 2019).\nAdding the two remaining models (EC-Earth and CNRM-CM6) confirms this impact of ocean resolution on the total Arctic seaice area (Table 3).",

      "As for ocean resolution, the impact of atmosphere resolution on the March Barents sea-ice area in control runs is comparable to historical runs (Table 3).\nThe contrasting behavior between the impact of ocean resolution on the total Arctic sea-ice area (Docquier et al., 2019) and its impact on the Barents sea-ice area (this study) reveals that it is important to inspect specific Arctic regions separately.\nIn the following, we will show that the OHT at the Barents Sea Opening is a possible reason for this difference.",

      "Treatment with nusinersen involves a fixed dosing regimen based on trials in infants and children with SMA type 1 or 2 and does not consider the clinical course of SMA, the progression rate of disease, or laboratory findings.\nIn infants with SMA type 1, phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H) and neurofilament light chain were elevated before treatment and decreased during treatment with nusinersen [10,11].\nTo date, there is little data regarding treatment of adult patients.",
      "Taken together, the results suggest that plasma phosphorylated neurofilaments heavy may be a useful biomarker for predicting motor function outcomes in SMA.\nThe utility of additional markers in cerebrospinal fluid of treated SMA patients is also matter of active research (36, 37).\n3"

      "We assess blood lactate level with Lactate Scout+ (SensLab GmbH, Leipzig, Germany), a validated hand-held analyzer [90].\nHeart rate is measured using the validated Polar\u00ae H7 chest strap (Polar OY, Finland) [91].\nParasympathetic drive is still present at lower exercise intensities and thus increases heart rate variability [92].",

      "One reason for this is that this company\u2019s systems are widely used on the market and Polar has many years of experience in the development and production of heart rate monitor systems [25].\nPrevious studies have confirmed that with the Polar heart rate monitors valid HRV parameters can be determined by comparing and testing measured values by the Polar watch V800 receiver linked with Polar H7 transmitter with an ECG used as a gold standard [23,24,42,43].\nIn addition, the Polar H7 receiver shows the required sampling rate of 1000 Hz for recording valid HRV parameters [19,25,42].",
      "Moreover, its spread and acceptance are beating the wearable market [21].\nThe present study sets out the comparison of RR intervals derived from Apple Watch using as reference the RR intervals derived from the Polar H7 chest belt heart rate monitor (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland), which has been already validated [22,23].\nAdditionally, this study includes the validation of HRV measurements, derived from the RR intervals from both devices, in two scenarios with different ANS balance: relax and metal stress.",
      "HRV measurements derived from Apple Watch were compared to those obtained from a validated heart rate monitor, in particular Polar H7 chest band.\nSeveral works in the literature have already validated, using as reference the RR interval series derived from a synchronous ECG, the RR interval series given by different models of Polar devices: S810 [35,36], RS800 [37,38], and V800 with a H7 chest belt [22,23].\nRegarding the RR intervals series, which are the basis for any HRV analysis, the bias was almost 0 and most pairs of RR intervals (around 96%) were within the limits of agreement in the Bland Altman plot.",
      "The objective of this work is the validation of a recently released Bluetooth PPG sensor\u2014James One (MindProber Labs, Porto, Portugal) for the ambulatory monitorization of a set of the most commonly used HRV metrics, that will be calculated from PP intervals provided by the sensor.\nAs a reference device, we will use the Polar H10 (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland), a new iteration of the previously validated polar chest straps that makes use of ECG to provide RR intervals [1,3,6,11,22].\nIn this study, data will be acquired simultaneously using these two devices, and the agreement between the HRV features calculated from the RR and PP intervals will be determined.",
      "In our work, we aimed to validate for the first time the HRV measurements calculated from the PP intervals obtained from the heart rate sensor, James One, under two different conditions, at rest and during a mental stress-inducing task.\nAs a reference, we used the RR intervals provided by a Polar H10 chest strap, an improved version of previously validated heart rate chest straps [1,3,6,11,22].\nRegardless of the presence or absence of agreement between the HRV metrics obtained from these two devices, we tried to determine if the data extracted from the James One could be used to detect changes caused by the execution of a mentally stressful task.",
      "Overall, the signal obtained from the James One and the Polar H10 appears to be good for both tasks, as a low number of abnormal intervals were detected.\nThis was expected for the data collected from the Polar chest straps, where high signal quality is reported, even on physically demanding activities [1,11,22].\nThe motion generated artifacts are one of the most common problems in the pulse wave signal, but other factors like skin tone or temperature can hurt the signal quality [4,15,19,20].",

      "One well-known caveat of applying in silico tools to predict pharmacogenetic effects is that most algorithms are trained using data on evolutionary conservation and whether or not the variant is predicted to cause disease.\nIn general, pharmacogenes are not typically associated with disease due to their limited physiological functions, thus they display lower evolutionary conservation in contrast to disease-associated genes which are under higher evolutionary pressure to retain endogenous function [24,25,64,71].\nFurthermore, a variant that precipitates an ADE may not cause an altered phenotype otherwise.",

      "9.\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, the method is very surface sensitive with the ID that reaches only 1\u20132 surface atomic layers [5].\nIndeed, a dominating peak at 705 eV is ascribed to ion scattering at Ca atoms [55].",
      "Graphene is a monoatomic thick 2-D nanomaterial with sp2-hybridized hexagonally 39 arranged carbon atoms.\nIt possesses exceptionally high electrical conductivity, thermal 40 stability, mechanical strength, UV protectivity, hydrophobicity, Joule heating capacity, and 41 high surface area [1-6].\nThe coating of graphene onto fabrics is a potential approach for the 42 proper exploitation of its unique properties.",
      "Actually, the reaction rates are very slow in chemical kinetics according to the Arrhenius theory because there is a high reaction potential barrier between the ceramic and the reaction product.\nHowever, during the tribological process of ceramics, tribochemical and mechanochemical behaviours are well recognised to promote the chemical reactions by changing the chemical potential of the solid [25,26].\nUnder the mechanical or tribological motivation, the oxidations of SiC and Si3N4 are accelerated significantly [27,28].",
      "As shown in Figure 2c and d, four different peaks at 284.6, 286.6, 288.3 and 289.\n0 eV were assigned to C=C/C\u2013C, C\u2013O, C=O and C(O)O groups respectively [33].\nAfter reduction, both the peaks associated with C-O, C=O and 10 C(O)O were reduced significantly.",
      "The carbonaceous-based materials, such as graphite [11], carbon nanotubes [12], activated carbons [1,13], and graphene [14\u201316], have been explored as metal-free catalysts for CWPO of recalcitrant organic contaminations.\nAmong that, graphene has received great attention in various fields owing to its excellent physical, chemical and electrical properties [17].\nAdditionally, the delocalized \u03c0 electrons of 2D graphene structure are easily conducted in the basal plane of graphene and have outstanding ability of donate or withdraw electrons [18,19].",
      "Owing to high electron affinity and mobility, fullerene and its derivatives have been universal acceptor materials for PSCs for the past two decades.4-6 Although non-fullerene acceptors are currently dominating the research and development of PSCs, fullerene derivatives still play a pivotal role in high performance ternary7-9 or tandem cells2.\nIn the fullerene acceptor family, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are the two most used acceptors in PSCs for their good solubility, high electron mobility, and matched energy levels with a wide range of polymer donors.\n10-12 Beyond them, the fullerene bis-adducts like bis-adduct of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (bisPC61BM) and indene-C60 bis-adduct (ICBA, see Figure 1 for the chemical structure) also attract much attention for their high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, which is good for achieving high open circuit voltage (VOC) of the cells,9, 13-15 since the VOC of PSCs is almost directly proportional to the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of donor and the LUMO level of acceptor.16, 17 The high VOC is especially important in tandem solar cell.",

      "Conversely, a multitude of orphan peptides exists that are candidate ligands for receptors, including GPCRs.\nIdentifying new and characterizing known ligand\u2013receptor interactions is essential in understanding GPCR biology in disease settings [6].\nHowever, due to the dynamic and transient interaction between (peptide) ligands and GPCRs, the study of the ligand binding and receptor activation of GPCRs is not straightforward.",
      "On the one hand, as the key core communicators of extracellular signals ranging from hormones, peptides, and lipids to photons, ions, and biogenic amines, \uff5e350 non-sensory GPCRs mediate many important biological and pathological processes [1-3].\nTherefore, GPCRs represent the critical and attractive therapeutic targets for various diseases, recently estimating that 34-35% of marketed drugs directly target and modulate GPCR signaling pathways [4, 5].\nOn the other hand, alternative mRNA splicing is a key mechanism for enabling a single gene to generate structurally and functionally distinct protein isoforms [6, 7].",
      "As such, novel strategies that allow the use of more relevant cell types early on in drug discovery are desirable.\nCurrently, ~110 GPCRs, which account for one third of the potentially druggable GPCRs, are targeted by ~475 FDA-approved GPCR-targeting drugs (Hauser et al., 2018; Sriram and Insel, 2018).\nAt the late preclinical stage, about 100 GPCRs are currently being evaluated as drug targets, whereby ~400 small molecule drugs are being investigated (Wacker et al., 2017).",
      "WIN552122-2) showed the least variation between individuals (Hillger et al., 2017).\nBesides differences in compliance or pharmacokinetics, genetic variation could help explain why so-called \u2018blockbuster\u2019 drugs only work in a subset of all patients (Hauser et al., 2018).\nCEI measurements may therefore be well-suited to identify whether a compound is fit for the general population or is prone to genetic differences (Hillger et al., 2017).",
      "Importantly, this fact also underlines why non-coding genetic variation, such as mutation in promoter regions, has to also be considered alongside protein polymorphisms when assessing how genetic variation links to health and to the efficacy of treatments (Ward and Kellis, 2012).\nAlready, receptor variation in humans is recognized as a major cause of GPCR-targeting drugs being ineffective in many individuals (Hauser et al., 2018), and it is possible that non-coding mutations that alter pathway stoichiometries could further explain such cases.\nWe anticipate that the tuning principles uncovered here in yeast will also be relevant for GPCR signaling in all eukaryotes, however, it is worth re-stressing the large diversity in the type and structure of downstream signaling pathways paired with GPCRs in different organisms and cell types.",
      "These genetic alterations are expected to change the profiles of signaling pathways engaged by the GPCRs, creating a situation that the same drug targeting the same receptor would produce varying effects due to RGS heterogeneity.\nSuch a situation may be cryptic in the population if one only profiles variation within GPCRs (Hauser et al., 2018), but it may still lead to interindividual variability in drug response.\nTherefore, understanding the impact of RGS proteins and their genetic variability onGPCR signaling is expected to be important for individualizing drug prescriptions in the implementation of precision medicine.",
      "One of the most clinically significant classes of molecules includes components of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) path- This is an open access article und ways, the largest gene family encoded in the human genome (Offermanns, 2003) and immensely successful drug targets (Santos et al., 2017).\nAccordingly, variations in GPCRs and G proteins significantly contribute to the pharmacogenomics burden, and mutations in their genes are linked to a number of diseases (Hauser et al., 2018; Insel et al., 2007; Spiegel and Weinstein, 2004).\nHowever, the complexity of molecular organization makes functional evaluation of genetic variation in GPCR signaling components in a scalable fashion not trivial.",
      "These gain-of-function mutations contribute for instance to WHIM syndrome (CXCR4 chemokine receptor), nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (AVPR2), non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism (TSH receptor), early puberty (Kiss1, LH, FSH receptors).\nCompared to other human genes, GPCRs exhibit a high frequency of non-synonymous polymorphisms (26-28).\nA number of 14 192 nsSNP have been identified in 108 GPCRs targeted by drugs, with about 128 rare and 3.7 common variants per receptor (26).",

      "Deletion of the meiosis-specific cohesin SMC1beta revealed a distinct role of cohesins in telomere attachment and integrity in the mouse.\nIn the absence of SMC1beta, telomere tethering and the stability of telomere attachment are impaired (Adelfalk et al.\u00a02009; Biswas et al.\u00a02018; Herran et al.\u00a02011).\nThe function of SMC1beta in promoting the complete and stable attachment of telomeres to the nuclear envelope is separable from its function in connecting sister chromatids.",
      "Although STAG3 and SMC1B together form a major part of the meiotic cohesin complex, SMC1B deficiency does not affect SPO11 activity [47].\nThis redundancy could be explained by the fact that the \u2018\u2018mitotic\u2019\u2019 SMC1A can cover some of the functions of SMC1B during meiotic prophase I [48].\nIn support of these data, we have found that the number of DMC1 foci in Stag3 / Smc1b / spermatocytes is similar to that in Stag3 / spermatocytes (unpublished data).",
      "SMC1B maps on human chromosome 22, at 22q13.\n31, and encodes a protein involved in sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome synapsis, and protects telomeres from rearrangement (Novak et al., 2008; Adelfalk et al., 2009; Biswas et al., 2013; Murdoch et al., 2013; Biswas et al., 2018).\nSMC1B is thought to be meiotic-specific; however, it has been shown that it is also expressed in mitotic cells and is mutually exclusive with SMC1A (Mannini et al., 2015).",
      "It should be noted that the phenotypes observed in these studies differ somewhat depending on the knockout allele of SA3/Stag3.\nAlthough SMC1\u03b1 can partly substitute SMC1\u03b2 in AE formation, SMC1\u03b2 is required for telomere integrity in the AE (Biswas et al., 2018).\nIn the absence of either REC8 (Bannister et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2005) or RAD21L (Herran et al., 2011; Ishiguro et al., 2014), AE formation is partially impaired: In the absence of REC8, AE length is shorter compared to wild type or Rad21L KO (Figure 4c); in the absence of RAD21L, AE is discontinuous and fragmented.",
      "However, it is important to note that telomere aberrations identical to those reported here have been observed in Smc1b / spermatocytes, while this meiosis-specific cohesin subunit is not expressed in premeiotic cells [23].\nMoreover, an elegant study expressing SMC1a under the control of the Smc1b promoter in Smc1b / mice showed restoration of several meiotic phenotypes including AEs/LEs length while telomere aberrations remained uncorrected [71].\nIt has therefore been suggested that SMC1b may facilitate the arrangement of telomere DNA into the so-called T-loop and/or the association of telomere factors to ensure proper telomere behavior.",
      "At meiotic entry, SMC1B becomes expressed and remains present on the centromeres until the metaphase/ anaphase II transition, whereas SMC1A is more prominent on the chromatin (Revenkova et al., 2001; Revenkova et al., 2004).\nThough it is possible that some functions of SMC1B could be supplied by SMC1A, it has recently been demonstrated that SMC1A cannot protect telomeres from damage (Biswas et al., 2018).\n",

      "From in vitro to in vivo reprogramming Decades of developmental biology research in various model organisms identified cell fate-inducing TFs that can be used for cellular reprogramming.\nForced expression of one single TF such as MyoD (induces muscle fate) [3], or C/EBPa (induces B-cell conversion to macrophages [6], and in Caenorhabditis elegans the Zn-finger TF CHE-1 (germ cell reprogramming to neurons) [7,8], or the GATA TF ELT-7 (induces intestinal fate) [9], can be sufficient to induce cell fate conversion.\nOther types of reprogramming require combination of different TFs: OSKM reprogram differentiated cells to iPSCs [5], Ascl1 +Brn2 +Myt1L transdifferentiate fibroblasts to neurons [10], and Ngn3 +Pdx1 +Mafa directly convert pancreatic cells to insulin-producing b-cells [11].",
      "Nevertheless, CRISPR/dCas9-TFs might prove to be powerful tools to induce or enhance in vivo reprogramming approaches.\nReprogramming inhibitory mechanisms The efficiency of reprogramming is generally limited due to cell fate safeguarding mechanisms, which act as barriers for reprogramming [7,8].\nWe already mentioned the necessity of a histone deacetylase inhibitor to reprogram MGCs into neurons upon ectopic expression of Ascl1 in mice which were older than 16 days [27].",
      "[46,47]), in part also due to studying in vivo reprogramming in model organisms such as the nematode C. elegans.\nIt allows investigating reprogramming barriers in vivo due to genetic tractability, ease of transgenesis and the feasibility of performing largescale genetic screens [7,8].\nFor instance, the histone chaperones LIN-53 (RBBP4/CAF-1p48) and FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) were initially identified in C. elegans as cell fate reprogramming barriers.",
      "For instance, the histone chaperones LIN-53 (RBBP4/CAF-1p48) and FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) were initially identified in C. elegans as cell fate reprogramming barriers.\nTheir mammalian counterparts were shown to block reprogramming to iPSCs and transdifferentiation to neurons in mice and human cells [7,47].\nThese examples demonstrate that understanding cell fate protection in model organisms can www.sciencedirect.com help to increase reprogramming efficiency of human cells for future regenerative medicine applications (Table 1).",
      "At the same time, mammalian FACT is not expressed or is expressed at much lower levels in non-tumor cells in vitro and in differentiated cells in vivo (Garcia et al., 2011).\nInhibition of FACT in FACT-positive normal cells has little effect on cell growth or viability (Garcia et al., 2013; Mylonas and Tessarz, 2018; Kolundzic et al., 2018).\nThese findings suggest that FACTmay be a promising target for anti-cancer treatment.",
      "Furthermore, depletion of FACT from tumor cells, which were the most sensitive to FACT knockdown, did not result in the inhibition of the expression of \u2018\u2018pro-cancerous\u2019\u2019 genes (Fleyshman et al., 2017).\nSimilarly, it was recently shown that there was no inhibition of the transcription of FACT-enriched genes in mouse embryonic stem cells or human fibroblasts (Mylonas and Tessarz, 2018; Kolundzic et al., 2018).\nThe aim of this study was to compare the effect of FACT loss in syngeneic mammalian cells at different stages of tumorigenic transformation to understand whether FACT has special function in transformed and tumor cells.",
      "Our initial hypothesis was that FACT is needed not for all transcription elongation, but for themost efficient high-rate transcription.\nIn support of this hypothesis, we and others observed correlation between FACT enrichment genome-wide and rates of transcription (Mylonas and Tessarz, 2018; Kolundzic et al., 2018; Heo et al., 2008).\nHowever, inactivation of FACT did not reduce the rates of transcription in any of the tested cells, ruling out the proposition that FACT is needed for transcription elongation.",
      "In addition, we observed a higher sensitivity of tumor cells to chromatin-destabilizing small molecules, which suggests that chromatin in tumor cells may be less stable under basal conditions than in normal cells (Gasparian et al., 2011; Safina et al., 2017).\nWe observed an interesting relationship between FACT and transcription in immortalized and transformed cells, which was different from that observed in normal mammalian stem and non-stem cells (Mylonas and Tessarz, 2018; Kolundzic et al., 2018).\nIn immortalized cells, FACT enrichment was more proportional to the level of gene transcription than that observed in transformed cells.",
      "It is intriguing to see that FACT sets a barrier to the acquisition of totipotent cell fate by ESCs (Figure 4A).\nThis is consistent with the notion that the FACT complex represses cell fate reprogramming (82), although the FACT complex is not essential to pluripotency maintenance (Figure 1G) (33,83).\nHere, we show that the FACT impedes 2-cell like fate conversion through suppressing cryptic promoters derived from TEs.",
      "In mouse embryonic stem cells, FACT can interact with the transcription factor Oct4 [36, 37] and have a role on cell fate determination [38].\nFACT can also safeguard cell identities and acts as a barrier for cell fate reprogramming in human fibroblasts [39].\nOur results suggest a potential role of FACT subunit SPT16 in shaping chromatin landscape at distal gene regulatory regions to establish and/or maintain PU.1 binding and macrophage identity."

      "While acrolein and pentanal were found to modify many relevant residues, under physiological conditions the profile of the modifications could be different, and only the most susceptible sites might be significantly modified.\nThe data presented here and previous literature suggest that the cysteine residues would be major sites of modification [4,35].\nFurthermore, the sequence coverage obtained was incomplete and varied depending on the treatment (typically 55-85%), and some potential modification sites, such as the N-terminal, were not covered; hence no conclusions can be drawn about whether modifications occurred at these sites.",
      "Quantitative analytical studies have been concentrated on specific compounds found in biological samples [13].\nBecause of their potential toxicity, glycerolipid aldehydes, also known as core aldehydes, and small aldehydes such as acrolein, malodialdehyde and hydroxyalquenals have been the most studied [13, 18].\nThe analytical approaches based on HPLC-MS used in most of these studies have not been adopted up to now.",
      "While it is clear that redox imbalance and increased production of certain oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or peroxynitrite can affect glycolytic enzymes directly, more reactive compounds such as hydroxyl radicals can also damage other cellular components and cause lipid peroxidation.\nThe peroxidation of lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids results in a wide range of reactive products, including short-chain aldehydes that are reactive and can cause covalent modifications of proteins [21, 22].\nThis type of secondary damage is known as lipoxidation and can occur via Schiff\u2019s base formation with lysine residues or formation of Michael adducts on histidine, cysteine or lysine residues [23, 24].",

      "energy usage).\nIf this is available for a range of (heterogeneous) architectures, the MCPs software can select, in a generic way and for each type of pattern, an optimal way to perform the multiscale simulation, given available hardware and even considering expected queuing times for that hardware [41].\nAlthough these are very recent developments, in our view such generic solutions for scheduling and executing multiscale simulations on complex computing ecosystems consisting of large HPC machines, distributed environments and clouds, and interfacing these solutions to the most popular multiscale coupling libraries and to the most relevant scheduling environments and queuing systems, could be extremely beneficial to users, who no longer need to worry about this time-consuming and complex phase of multiscale computing.",

      "Hence, distinct computational models of hiPSC-CMs have been suggested as a tool to gain mechanistic insight into their immature phenotype [107], to interpret experimental findings in specific hiPSC-CM cell lines [133] and to translate from hiPSC-CMs to human adult CMs [73], [252], [93].\nThe series of papers [180], [181], [184], [185], [182] features corrective adaptations of a single cell ODE model (1) of a ventricular-like hiPSC-CM with membrane clock driven automaticity.\nIn [107], the model of [181] is complemented by a PDE diffusion equation for the calcium release from the sacroplasmatic reticulum, which accounts for the calcium clock as the second mechanism behind the spontaneous activity of hiPSC-CMs.",
      "Of note, the biomarkers computed on APs and CaTrs after drug administration were not used for the parameter set identification with MoGAs.\nDrug administration was simulated with the single pore block model on the three control populations, as in [8].\nIn Table 3 we reported the IC50 and the Hill\u2019s coefficients for the four drugs, together with the experimentally administered doses and the blocking effects on the ionic currents.",
      "Changes in these CaV and various KV currents may affect the expressivity of SCN5A channelopathies.\nFor example, a decrease in ICa,L and/or increase Ito (Figure 2B, in red) may increase phase-1 repolarization and lower the AP plateau phase which may promote ST-segment elevation and BrS (45), while an increase in ICa,L and/or decrease of KV currents (Figure 2C, in red) will result in longer APs thus promoting LQT3 (46).\nBelow, we provide an overview of various known genetic and non-genetic disease modifiers of inherited cardiac SCN5A channelopathies, which are summarized in Figure 3.",
      "Specifically for hiPSC-CMs, the use of advanced in silico modeling techniques are extremely important to manage one of the main hiPSC-CM challenges, i.e., their electrophysiological variability observed in vitro [16].\nThe population of in silico models [17,18] approach enables the development of a huge ensemble of in silico models which, after experimental calibration, mimics the behavior of the in vitro population of cells, with all the aforementioned advantages of model usage.\nIn this case, the added value consists of having an in silico cell population that is way larger than whatever population could be obtained or analyzed in vitro.",
      "As a matter of fact, the literature presents electrophysiological investigations on hiPSC-CMs performed on samples containing only a few cells, while an in silico population contains at least hundreds of models.\nWe recently used this modeling technique to investigate the LQT3 syndrome effect on in silico hiPSC-CMs and to predict the effects of two drugs, commonly used in this syndrome treatment, also elucidating possible mechanisms for the development of adverse drug effects [18].\nThe same approach was used also by Passini et al.",

      "However, a growing body of research is demonstrating that certain genetic factors, such as PNPLA3, may induce a type of fatty liver disease that differs from the normal metabolic syndrome (33, 34).\nIn particular, patients with PNPLA3-mediated fatty liver disease show a lack of insulin resistance and normal serum triglyceride levels due to an altered lipidomic landscape within the liver with fewer ceramides, and a failure to export lipids synthesized within the liver to the bloodstream (35).\nGiven the similarities, it is possible that there is some mechanistic overlap between this genetic model of NAFLD and the Arid1a loss-driven model.",
      "A similar pattern was seen with another thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone) in the PIVENS study, with improvements in lobular inflammation without change in fibrosis.\n(23) One possible explanation for this observation is the notable difference observed between icosabutate and rosiglitazone in the ability of icosabutate to lower the hepatic concentrations of multiple hepatic NASH-associated lipotoxic lipid species (FFAs,(24) ceramides,(25) bile acids,(26) DAG,(24) arachidonic acid (AA),(27) and AA-derived HETEs(28)) in addition to hepatic oxidative stress\u2014 effects not seen with rosiglitazone.\nThe decrease in hepatic bile acid concentrations can be explained by the PPAR\u03b1-agonistic activity of icosabutate, as PPAR-\u03b1 activators suppress bile acid synthesis.",

      "Chronic exposure to excess saturated NEFA in the setting of visceral obesity can also lead to de novo biosynthesis of ceramides [6], members of the sphingolipid family that are ubiquitous lipid constituents of cell membranes and play a key role in the regulation of signal transduction pathways [7].\nAbnormal accumulation of ceramides may contribute to lipid-induced skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin resistance [8, 9], especially among those with obesity [10], and is a putative intermediate link between excess adiposity, inflammation and metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus [11, 12].\nHowever, existing evidence regarding the role of ceramides in insulin resistance syndromes and type 2 diabetes comes mostly from in vitro experiments, animal models or translational studies with limited sample sizes [13, 14].",
      "Since PNPLA3 expression levels are extremely low in a fasting status [35] and an increased PBG is better correlated with insulin resistance than the FBG [40], it is understandable that the PNPLA3 G variant has more influence on the OGTT 2 h PBG than the FBG.\nThe mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of PNPLA3 gene variants on glucose metabolism may be related to changes in the liver lipid composition from saturated triacylglycerol to polyunsaturated triacylglycerol and a marked reduction in insulin-resistance-inducing ceramides [41].\nOne recent study indicated that PNPLA3 functions as a very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid-specific triacylglycerol hydrolase, which promotes transfer of polyunsaturated fatty acids from triacylglycerol to phosphatidylcholine and that the PNPLA3 C>G variant causes an 80% reduction in PNPLA3 activity and a reduction in the ratio of saturated to polyunsaturated triacylglycerol in the liver [42].",
      "SFAs promote reactive oxygen species accumulation and affect mitochondrial metabolism [35].\nFurther, it has been suggested that insulin resistance in the liver is associated with increased concentration of saturated TGs [36], indicating they induce negative metabolic effects in both free forms and incorporated in larger molecular scaffolds.\nIn our data, saturated TGs were highly concentrated in hepatocytes with macrovesicular steatosis.",

      "The common rs641738 C>T variant linked to the 3\u2019 untranslated region of the MBOAT7 has been linked with MBOAT7 downregulation (63).\nIn keeping with this prediction, impaired MBOAT7 expression results in reduced levels of phophatidylinositol containing arachidonic acid, both in hepatocytes and in the circulation (63, 67).\nAccumulating evidence show that downregulation of MBOAT7 expression is implicated in NAFLD development during obesity and insulin resistance and reflects altered phospholipid remodeling in hepatocellular lipid droplets, specifically lysophosphatidylinositol lipids, whose administration in mice directly promotes fibrogenic and inflammatory changes in an MBOAT7-dependent manner (68, 69).",
      "SMOC2 knockout exerted a protective role in HFD-induced NAFLD mainly through restraining fat accumulation, fibrosis and inflammatory response by the interaction with TGF-b1.\nHepatic lipid levels are determined by an interplay between de novo lipogenesis, lipid uptake and fatty acid b-oxidation [15].\nImportantly, lipogenesis in liver is promoted during NAFLD progression, and genetic disruption of the liver lipogenic program inhibits NAFLD [16].",
      "TM6SF2 E167K variant is associated with increased risk for progressive MASH but reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.\nThe E167K variant leads to decreased expression of the gene and leads to its diminished function [32].\nIt is associated with increased fat accumulation in the liver, due to reduction in lipid secretion (via VLDL export).",
      "We found that the metabolic association profile of DHCR24 rs588709-G was similar to the metabolic association profile of TM6SF2 rs58542926-T.\nThis loss-offunction allele impairs VLDL secretion due to shortage in phosphatidylcholines resulting in hepatic triglyceride accumulation [52] and concordant reduction in circulating lipid levels [46].\nBased on the highly matching metabolic profiles of the two variants (R2= 0.74) and the fact that phosphatidylcholines are the only phospholipids required for the assembly and secretion of VLDL particles [59], it is possible that the VLDL-lowering effect of the DHCR24 rs588709-G could arise from altered phosphatidylcholine metabolism.",
      "The intrahepatic lipid composition with PNPLA3 rs738409 is predominantly shown to consist of polyunsaturated triacylglycerols and not metabolically harmful ceramides or diacylglycerols, which along with saturated or monounsaturated triacylglycerols and fatty acids are abundant in obesity-related NAFLD [29,30].\nLikewise, TM6SF2 rs58542926 enriches the hepatic lipidome with triglycerides, cholesteryl-esters and polyunsaturated fatty acids, but diminishes its phosphatidylcholine levels [31].\nNeutral lipids such as triglycerides and esters do not induce insulin resistance [32], and polyunsaturated fatty acids are also considered protective against liver injury and CVDs [33,34].",
      "The results highlighted that patients carrying risk alleles of PNPLA3 or TM6SF2 had significant lower triglycerides circulating levels, mainly the most abundant species such as TG(16:0/18:2/18:1) and TG(16:0/18:1/18:1) [48].\nA lipidomic study in a cohort of 90 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients who underwent laparoscopy bariatric surgery indicated that the TM6SF2 E167K variant induced an impaired synthesis of polyunsaturated complex lipids that leads to a deficiency in phosphatidylcholines molecules rich in PUFA [49].\nAs these species are the main phospholipids composing the outer layer of VLDL particles, a deficiency in their synthesis consequently impairs VLDL formation and export.",

      "The NAFLD risk allele TM6SF2 rs58542926-T is a loss-of-function variant resulting in a misfolded protein undergoing accelerated degradation (14).\nThe mechanism leading to impaired lipidation, subsequent degradation, and thus reduced secretion of VLDL particles seem to be due to deficiency in polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines in TM6SF2 rs58542926-T carriers (34).\nThis allele associates with reduced concentrations of multiple lipid species in circulation while it has no influence on qualitative measures of circulating lipids, such as fatty acid saturation (Fig 1, Panel 5).",

      "Jo ur na l P re -p ro of The production of gnotobiotic honey bees is rather simple, as bees can be deprived of gut symbionts via elimination of their oral-anal transmission route by isolating mature pupae in sterile rearing boxes and allowing adults to emerge in incubators [18].\nThis avoids the potentially confounding effects of the antibiotic exposure often required to produce germ-free individuals in other organisms and results in bees colonized only by transient, environmental bacteria at very low abundance, which are referred to as microbiota-depleted (MD) [56].\nAll bacterial strains associated with the honey bee can be cultured in the laboratory and re- inoculated in MD bees by the simple addition of bacterial cultures to the food or by \u2018pipette- feeding\u2019 defined quantities of bacteria in sugar water, producing bees colonized by any combination of bacterial strains [18].",

      "Similar to humans, honey bees possess a core microbiota that matures during early development and remains relatively stable throughout most of adult life (Figure 1).\nConsensus accepts that this core microbiota consists of six to ten core phylotypes [3] which are consistently found in honey bees independent of geography or sympatry [4].\nIn comparison, young larvae lack a definable microbiota phenotype and are often considered germ-free [5].",
      "Notably though, absolute quantification of bacteria in adults bearing V. destructor showed that all core gutmicrobiotamembers were significantly higher, and alongside increased viral titer loads, suggests that V. destructor inflicts a near complete loss of microbial regulation [59].\nHost Nutrient Deficiency and Excess The honey bee microbiota impacts nutritional status by playing a critical role in vitamin biosynthesis [62], breakdown of recalcitrant pollen components [3], and metabolism of toxic sugars [63].\nDespite this, foraging on monocultures, which is common in an agricultural setting, can limit access to diverse or rare nutrients.",
      "Evidence suggests that the honeybee gut microbiome comprises circa 108\u2013109 microbes [13].\nAlthough this microbiome is relatively simple in structure, it plays important roles in host metabolism, growth, development, immunity, and defense [13,15,16].\nHoneybees (mainly Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (Bombus species) are key pollinators of many plants (domesticated and wild), and their microbiomes have been studied in far more depth than those of other insect pollinators.",
      "It also links the fitness of hosts and their symbionts, which may facilitate mutualistic coevolution [22,24].\nFor example, intimate interactions between individual bees enable direct transfer of microbiota to the newly emerged offspring while minimizing exposure to external microbial sources [15,16].\nBased on current literature [13,15,16,25], it can be argued that vertical transfer is the major route for core microbiome assembly for social bees, but horizontal transmission may play a bigger role in plant microbiome assembly from soils by roots (Figure 1)."

      "[6].\nIt has recently been demonstrated in phantom measurements and is most promising regarding in-vivo implementation [9].\nSince current impressed in vivo in the human head is limited by safety regulations to the low-mA range [10, 11] and only a small fraction of the current passes the relatively highly-resistive skull [12, 13], a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) may be difficult to reach.",
      "In reality, there are other factors, such as non-idealities in the gradient ramps and unknown relaxation profiles, that affect the voxel values as well.\nTherefore, the relative changes in vn associated with the current density are recovered by normalization with a reference un [6, 9].\nRepeating the sequence for three orthogonal starting magnetizations m0,x = |m0|ex, m0,y = |m0|ey and m0,z = |m0|ez (shown in Figure 1), the last two rows of 8n can be measured.",

      "It was suggested that any vaccine used for active immunization of disease contacts should optimally induce protection that lasts at least two years and ideally up to ten years [18,19].\nIn this regard, studies of residual immune responses in naturally recovered survivors are likely to improve our understanding of Ebola virus correlates of protection, which will help guide vaccine development [14,15].\nTowards improving our understanding of recovery from and longterm immunity to Filoviruses, we studied antigen-specific immune responses in long-term survivors of the 2000\u20132001 SUDV outbreak in Gulu, Uganda.",

      "Considering the low number of reported cases of late sexual transmission, it is conceivable that the risk of sexual transmission of ZIKV beyond 2\u20133\u00a0months after infection is very low.\nStudies are, however, warranted to determine the replication capacity and viability of ZIKV in the semen of chronically infected patients, to correlate ZIKV RNA load in semen with infectivity, and to evaluate the effect of ZIKV infection on male fertility [25, 27].\nAnalysis of ZIKV NS1-specific IgM and IgG antibody responses identified different kinetics in flavivirus-naive patients and in those with previous DENV infection: Whereas patients with primary ZIKV infection developed high-titer IgM antibodies at about 8\u00a0days after the onset of symptoms, followed by IgG antibodies, patients with previous dengue did not develop detectable ZIKV IgM antibodies, but had already high titer ZIKV IgG antibodies at the time of diagnosis.",
      "Of note, the prostate or seminal vesicles were unaffected and innate immune responses were found in Leydig, Sertoli and epididymal epithelial cells, but not in peritubular cells and spermatogonia, exposing these cells as particularly vulnerable for ZIKV infection and as possible repositories for ZIKV (Ma et al., 2017).\nAlthough Zika viral load in semen, impaired semen quality and sexual transmission have been reported (D\u2019Ortenzio et al., 2016; Epelboin et al., 2017; Joguet et al., 2017; Paz-Bailey et al., 2017), it remains to be elucidated how murine testicular disease translates to the clinic (Meinhardt, 2017).\nIn general, studies using these specific infections, however, are complicated by the high degree of species specificity among the viruses and their hosts."

      "Some of these candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials, including those based upon recombinant adenoviruses [6] and recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) [7].\nWhilst it is not straightforward to compare the serological data presented in the two studies, antibody responses with chimpanzee adenovirus reduced after 6 months [8] whereas responses after a single dose with rVSV remained high for at least 2 years [9].\nWhilst anti-EBOV responses primed with the recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine may be boosted with a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)based vaccine expressing the same Ebola transgene [10], this approach of multiple immunisations combining different constructs represents significant challenges both in gaining regulatory approval and in their use in an outbreak situation.",
      "While the MV-CHIK Phase II trial suggested that a second immunization would be required to maintain high chikungunya-neutralizing antibody levels, a single dose might be sufficient for travelers\u2019 vaccinations.\nFor comparison, the replicating recombinant VSV vector platform has shown potential for long-lasting immunogenicity after a single immunization as seen in the strong antibody response to rVSV-ZEBOV two years after immunization [77].\nHowever, while generally shown to be well-tolerated in the Phase III trials, some safety concerns for the rVSV vector remain due to the observation of side effects (including arthritis) in a Phase I trial, the neurotropism of VSV, and the potential spillover of the vector into livestock (reviewed in [78]).",

      "Importantly, optimized matrix application and sample preparation methods are required to prevent tissue damage and allow subsequent histologic analysis of the tissue section.\nFor example, MALDI imaging of a tissue section followed by hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) (Deutskens, Yang, & Caprioli, 2011), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and/or fluorescent staining (Kaya et al., 2017) have been reported by utilizing lower ionization energy matrix compounds, thus requiring fewer laser shots per pixel, and by incorporating matrix washing protocols after MALDI analysis.\nThis capability of integrating MALDI data with histologic tissue analysis is crucial in clinical applications to precisely correlate molecular and histologic information as well as facilitate translation and incorporation of MALDI into clinical workflows.",

      "Quantification by sequential product ion scans (MS/MSALL) on HRMS instruments has been applied with shotgun analysis but the cycle times (> 2 s) are too long to be suitable for comprehensive quantitative LC (i.e., class separation) [23].\nAn alternative approach based on LC-HRMS is the use of parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) for quantitative analysis, but requires two injections one for the determination of the precursor ions and the second for quantification [24, 25].\nHRMS lipid data are usually processed using in silico generated MS libraries [26, 27] since the fragments are predictable, as lipids are generated from common building blocks and analogues within a class exhibit similar fragmentation behavior (e.g., polar head groups, fatty acids), and the variety of lipid species is too large (> 200,000) to create an experimental database.",
      "Reported lipidomes identified from each study object differ significantly in the distribution of lipid classes as well as molecular species in each class.\nThus, 390 species representing six lipid classes were identified in human plasma with majority of the species corresponding to glycerophosphocholines, followed by glycerolipids and sphingophospholipids [9].\nFurthermore, 370 lipid molecular species were identified in human skin [10] and recently quantitative values for 286 lipid species covering seven orders of magnitude in concentrations were reported for the human platelet lipidome [11].",
      "A recent work combined meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid epoxidation reaction and the MS/MS strategy to assist in the identification of the double bond position isomers in unsaturated complex lipids, a method which is suitable for a high-throughput lipidomics analysis [50].\nThe employment of an isotope-assisted approach combined with enhanced isomer separation with the C30 fused-core reversed-phase material and a powerful MS platform may also be helpful in improving lipid identification, as recently introduced [51].\nThe online utilization of the Patern\u00f2\u2013B\u00fcchi reaction and an RPLC-MS/MS pipeline were developed to identify the double-bond locations in 1 3 isobaric ether-linked and diacyl phospholipids, 13C isobars, and acyl chain isomers in biological samples [52].",

      "A disadvantage may 70 be the lack of sensitivity (low abundant lipids are often suppressed by highly abundant ones) 71 and limited identification coverage [16].\nOn the other hand, discovery of unknowns is limited 72 to ultra-high resolution MS [8].\nLC-MS based methods allow more reliable identification even 73 at lower concentration levels [17].",
      "The chemical formula C19H28O5S was found with an error of 7 ppm as compared to the theoretical mass of the [M-H]- adduct of C19H28O5S.\nMeasured MS/MS spectra were matched against the HMDB database using MS-FINDER [7, 8].\nThe experimental spectrum showed a good match to the in silico MS/MS spectrum of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS).",
      "Lipids play critical roles in membrane composition, energy storage and signal transduction[1, 2].\nOwing to the unique biological significance, lipidomics which aims at characterizing global changes of lipid metabolites in response to internal or external subtle perturbations in a given biological system has been dramatically advanced[3-5].\nIn the last decade, impressive results of lipidomics have been obtained in the fields of biomarker discovery and biomedical mechanism researches.",
      "For example, it is known that hydroperoxy-54 PE derivatives are involved in the mediation of ferroptotic cell death [7].\nAlso, oxidised PS, 55 including long chain oxidation products such as hydroxy-PS and hydroperoxy-PS, contribute to 56 apoptotic cell recognition by macrophages [8,9].\nOxidised PE has been associated with a pro-57 inflammatory phenotype in human peripheral blood [10,11].",
      "Recent developments in lipidomics enabled routine quantification of several hundred lipid molecules from a few microliters of blood plasma [2\u20134].\nA combined effort of several laboratories within the LIPID MAPS consortium quantified 588 individual molecules from 22 lipid classes in a reference National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 1950 sample and provided the most comprehensive snapshot of the plasma lipid composition to date [5].\nIn 2017 NIST spearheaded a comparative study in which the composition of the same reference plasma sample was independently assessed by 31 participating laboratories [6].",
      "Obtaining a near-complete labelling efficiency is important, as otherwise, the concentration of lipids would be overestimated.\nThe labelled yeast lipid extract can then be used to correct for matrix effects, both in yeast and other matrices such as human plasma [13], and for more accurate quantitation.\nAlthough the yeast lipidome comprises fewer lipid classes and lipid species than more complex mammalian lipidomes, this is a helpful approach to account for ionization differences and matrix effects during lipidomic analysis."

      "GPCRs have proved refractory to crystallization, relative to other protein classes, a difficulty that arises from the low conformational homogeneity of these signalling proteins and something that has only recently been resolved through the application of several innovative protein engineering techniques and crystallography methods [6\u20139].\nAs a consequence, there has been a recent and prolific increase in the number of the GPCR structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [10] and structural evidence for GPCR oligomers is now being added to the weight of evidence obtained from biological methods of studying GPCR oligomers in native cells, in tissues or in recombinant mammalian expression systems [11] to inform a holistic understanding of the nature of these signalling proteins.\nExperimentally determined oligomeric GPCR structures Ironically, now that we have unequivocally demonstrated the biological existence of GPCR homodimers and heterodimers and have successfully crystallized many members of this protein superfamily, it transpires that although there are over 300 solved GPCR structures [12], the overwhelming majority of these are, in fact, monomeric.",
      "Unlike Class C GPCRs, which dimerize through their large extracellular N terminal domain, dimerization of Class A GPCRs is widely accepted to take place through interactions between specific transmembrane helices of the individual monomers [4].\nWe have developed an ensemble-based coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach for the computational prediction of helix\u2013helix interactions in G protein-coupled receptors [11].\nThis method allows the sampling of all computational space and potential conformations and orientations of interacting helices.",
      "We were also able to show that the interacting helices for the two other GPCR dimers available at that time, the b1 adrenergic receptor and rhodopsin, interacted through TM4:TM5.\nWhile these receptors were also believed to interact through TM1:TM1, we were able to demonstrate that this was only true for the adrenergic receptor and that rhodopsin\u2019s TM1 helices were in close proximity to each other, but the interaction was identified as being between TM1: TM2 [11].\nBy using only transmembrane domains for these analyses, this method specifically interrogates interactions formed between residues in each monomer, providing a starting point to the high-throughput identification of potential dimer partners while avoiding issues of starting bias inherent in the use of full GPCR structures that contain extracellular and intracellular loops and other features such as lipids that can influence, but do not necessarily define, the dimerization interface between monomers.",

      "This range was extended to shorter distances by exploiting the phenomenon of self-quenching of identical fluorophores (8), quenching by radical (9), quenching through the electron transfer with a tryptophan or tyrosine residue (10,11), or the proteininduced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE) (12).\nFRET was also combined with PIFE to gain a concomitant information about molecular interactions on different distance scales (13).\nThere were also attempts of nanoscopic ruling at distances exceeding the upper FRET limit by using the interaction of two metallic nanoparticles (14) or a metallic particle and a fluorophore (15).",
      "Hence, any process that shifts the Cy3 conformational state to favor the trans conformation will result in a Cy3 fluorescence enhancement (23,24).\nIt has been proposed that the interaction of Cy3 with a protein can sterically hinder the Cy3 isomerization favoring the trans form and thereby enhance its fluorescence intensity (24,25).\nWe had shown previously that when human RPA (hRPA) binds to a stretch of 30 oligodeoxythymidylates labeled at its 30 end with Cy3, 30-Cy3-(dT)30, the Cy3 fluorescence is enhanced by 72%, and we used this effect to monitor the diffusion of hRPA along poly(dT) (20).",

      "In the case of BC, the dominant rapid adjustments affecting the radiation budget are reductions in high cloud (increasing outgoing longwave radiation), increases in low-level stratocumulus (increasing outgoing shortwave radiation) (Koch and Del Genio, 2010; Stjern et al., 2017), and negative longwave feedback due to warming of the upper troposphere (Sand et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2018).\nThese adjustments in cloud and temperature are linked to BC increasing the static stability of the troposphere and associated reductions in convection at the global scale (Ming et al., 2010; Frieler et al.\u00a02011; Andrews et al., 2010; Samset et al., 2016; Myhre et al., 2018).\nHowever, at regional scales absorbing aerosol can increase or decrease precipitation and convection as atmospheric dynamics adjust to the inhomogeneous distribution of radiative heating (Menon et al., 2002; Meehl et al., 2006; Wang 2009; Liu et al., 2018).",

      "As found in earlier global modelling studies (e.g.\nKoch and Del Genio, 2010; Stjern et al., 2017) we find that BC absorption leads to an overall reduction of high cloud (Fig 2a,g) and ice water path (IWP) (Fig 2c,i) due to the suppression of deep convection.\nThere are also statistically significant regional changes including increases of high cloud, IWP and LWP in a belt stretching over tropical Africa and Asia.",
      "The strongest increases, of up to 15%, are in the Northeast Pacific in the freerunning experiment.\nThis tendency to thicken low cloud is consistent with BC heating leading to increased lower tropospheric stability (LTS) (Fig 2f,l), which favours the formation of marine stratocumulus (Johnson et al., 2004; Wilcox 2010; Del Genio et al., 2010; Stjern et al., 2017).\nThis response is in essence captured in the nudged experiment, although the changes in low-cloud fraction and LWP are less pronounced over the North Pacific and North Atlantic (Fig 2b,d,h,j), related to weaker or more globally uniform increases in LTS (Fig 2f,l).",
      "These effects, which occur independently of any subsequent change in surface temperature, are commonly termed rapid adjustments to the instantaneous (direct) radiative forcing of BC (Boucher et al., 2013).\nDifferent climate forcers, such as BC, scattering aerosols or CO2, can induce very different rapid adjustments (on short timescale typically days) (Smith et al., 2018; Stjern et al., 2017).\nSlow feedbacks on the other hand, caused by the response in surface temperatures, seems to be less dependent on the initial climate forcer (Richardson et al., 2018).",
      "The precipitation response on a long timescale was found to be negative at all altitudes, except when BC was inserted between the surface and 900 hPa.\nAnalysis from the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP) suggests that the rapid adjustments of BC are negative and offset more than half of its instantaneous effect (Smith et al.\u00a02018).\nHere we analyze the precipitation response to BC inserted at different altitudes in more detail, by adding one more model to the analysis (GISS ModelE) and by separating between the rapid adjustments in the atmosphere and the slow feedbacks linked to surface temperature changes.",

      "For hydrophilic sBVOCs like many alcohols, a substantial fraction is probably dissolved in soil water.\nIn both cases, an increase in temperature would change the partition coefficient between sorbed and/or dissolved BVOCs and gaseous BVOCs and lead to more BVOCs in the soil air (Tang et al., 2019).\nWe also found positive correlations between soil moisture and concentrations of some sBVOCs.",

      "Efficacy of Climate Forcings in PDRMIP Models",
      "The rationale of this forcing is that the timescale of stratospheric temperature response is several months, much shorter than the timescale of the sea surface temperature (SST) change, which ranges from decades to centuries.\nIncluding the rapid stratospheric temperature adjustment in the forcing provides a better predictor for the long\u2010term climate change than the instantaneous forcing (Hansen et al., 2005).\nThe stratosphere\u2010adjusted forcing is also the standard radiative forcing used in the IPCC report (Ramaswamy et al., 2001).",
      "Since the land surface response is a rapid process, we also include the land surface temperature change, which is caused by the tropospheric adjustment in the fully adjusted forcing.\nThe fully adjusted forcing provides the best prediction for the long\u2010term climate change, but it requires running the climate model for years to minimize the noise due to chaotic weather in the model (Hansen et al., 2005).\nThe SWV instantaneous forcing and SWV stratosphere\u2010adjusted forcing are estimated by an online diagnostic radiative transfer calculation, which does not affect the model state for prognostic calculations.",

      "MPL-dependent and TPO-independent megakaryopoiesis caused by mutant CALR were demonstrated in murine lineage-negative cells [12], patient-derived CD34+ cells [21], and human iPS-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells [20, 22], demonstrating that MPL-dependent transformation by mutant CALR is a cause of megakaryocytosis in CALRmutant MPN.\nThe constitutive activation of MPL by mutant CALR resulted in the activation of JAK2 and its downstream molecules, including ERK1/2 and STAT5 [12, 13, 15, 20, 23, 24].\nTaken together, this implies that the mutant CALR lies on the MPL-JAK2 axis in the development of MPN, and rationalizes the use of JAK inhibitors in CALR-mutant MPN patients.",

      "Nevertheless, mutant CALR does activate JAK-STAT signaling (1) (Figure 2B), with an obligatory requirement for JAK2 as demonstrated when megakaryocyte colonies failed to M AN US CR IP T AC CE PT ED grow following knockdown of JAK2 from CALR-mutated patient progenitors (41).\nMutant CALR also activates mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways to augment megakaryocyte formation (42).\nCALR-mutated MPN is only associated with an ET or MF phenotype (38).",
      "Interestingly, mutations in CALR result in reductions in intracellular levels of CALR mutant protein and increased secretion of CALR (34,35).\nWhile paracrine effects of secreted CALR mutant proteins were not uniformly observed, Dao and colleagues observed that secreted CALR mutant protein may indeed exert activity, enhancing inflammatory cytokine production in normal (37,38).\nFurther work is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of aberrant characteristics of CALR mutant proteins as well as the question of how these specific characteristics may be exploited therapeutically (Figure 2).",

      "This results in structural changes in the receptor that lead to the recruitment of a heterotrimeric G\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3, followed by the nucleotide exchange in G\u03b1, and finally resulting in the dissociation of the G\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 protein into G\u03b1 and G \u03b2\u03b3 subunits.\nHowever, combinatorics of this process is very large, since one receptor can interact with multiple G\u03b1 proteins and multiple receptors can couple to the same G\u03b1 protein [5].\nThis point is illustrated by Fig.",
      "Very recently, the analysis of GPCR X-ray structures coupled to different signaling proteins has shed light on commonalities and similarities at the coupling interface [32].\nPhylogenetic analysis of human G proteins has identified \u201cselectivity barcodes\u201d in G proteins sequences that are uniquely recognized by GPCRs [33].\nFrom the WT hA3AR R state MD analysis we identified the presence/persistency of D1073.49\u2013R1083.50 and E2256.30\u2013R1113.53 salt-bridges as inactive state signatures.",
      "Compared with other commercial cathode materials, LiMn2O4 possesses remarkable cost advantage and high ratio of performance to price [1\u20134].\nNevertheless, the large-scale application of LiMn2O4 is greatly limited by the poor cycling performance, especially the high-temperature performance [5,6].\nThe corresponding reasons are mainly attributed to the Jahn-Teller effect of trivalent Mn ions and dissolution of manganese [7,8].",
      "The notion of a singular cognate G-protein for each receptor is also one that is challenged by evidence of receptor promiscuity to several Ga classes (23,24), including melanopsin promiscuously acti- 390 Biophysical Journal 119, 389\u2013401, July 21, 2020 vating transducin in vitro (25).\nGPCR regions important for G-protein binding selectivity include the second and third intracellular loops and cytoplasmic extensions of transmembrane helices 5 and 6, which form critical contacts with helices 4 and 5 on Ga (26).\nGPCR C-termini can regulate Gprotein activation as well as serve as substrates for GPCR kinase to mediate arrestin binding (for melanopsin C-terminal phosphorylation and deactivation, see (27\u201333)).",
      "These studies show that GDP release occurs within seconds of mixing purified b2ARwith GsGDP, whereas formation of the stable b2ARGsempty complex observed by crystallography takes much longer (Du et al., 2019 [in this issue of Cell]).\nA recent study using protein sequence analysis to understand GPCR-G protein coupling specificity suggests that several residues on the a5 helix are part of a G protein-specific bar code (Flock et al., 2017).\nOf interest, H387Gas, R389Gas, Y391Gas, and E392Gas are all part of the Gs-specific bar code.",
      "Among them, the largest class is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family (Fredriksson et al., 2003; Hilger et al., 2018; Mahoney and Sunahara, 2016).\nGPCRs exhibit clear preferences for activating particular Ga species, and there has been tremendous progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms in establishing this selectivity (Flock et al., 2017; Inoue et al., 2019; Masuho et al., 2015b; Okashah et al., 2019).\nThe opposing process of G protein deactivation occurs when G proteins hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP), a process assisted by the action of the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)."

      "Truncating and missense mutations affecting KMT2D are observed in 60-70% of FL cases and loss of KMT2D results in decreased global H3K4 methylation levels and down-regulation of key sets of genes involved in immune signaling and B cell differentiation [35,50].\nInactivating mutations of the acetyltransferase CREBBP are seen at a similar frequency and also exert pleiotropic effects on gene expression, potentially in part mediated by defective acetylation of BCL6 and TP53 [36,48,51,52].\nGainof-function mutations of EZH2 increase gene repression via enhanced H3K27 trimethylation and result in repression of plasma cell differentiation signatures [53].",

      "In the absence of oxygen, ATTO647N showed photobleaching times on the minute timescale, which was accompanied by frequent on/off blinking on the millisecond timescale (figure 1(a)).\nThis blinking can be assigned to a triplet-related darkstate (off-state lifetime of 29 \u00b1 5 ms) [27].\nWhen bound to the photostabilizer NPA, the photophysical behaviour of ATTO647N changed and bright non-blinking molecules were observed (figure 1(b)).",
      "In contrast, the majority of NPA-ATTO647N molecules survived even a second cycle of confocal/STED imaging (figures 2(b) and (c), inset), as evidenced by the number of yellow spots in the confocal 1 + 2 image (figures 2(a) and (b)).\nThese results suggest that intramolecular photostabilization remains effective not only for fluorescent labels in fixed cells [27] but also for single-molecules under STED imaging conditions and high excitation power.\nFor a quantitative analysis, the same series of alternating confocal and STED images was repeated at different powers of the STED beam (figure 2(c)).",

      "Laboratory observations of slow earthquakes and the spectrum of tectonic fault slip modes",
      "The mechanics of regular, fast earthquakes in particular are based on laboratory studies of stick-slip frictional instability [e.g., Scholz, 2002].\nMore recently, laboratory observations have begun to illuminate the mechanics of slow slip and oscillatory stable sliding [e.g., Kaproth and Marone, 2013; Ikari et al., 2013, 2015; Leeman et al., 2016; Scuderi et al., 2016].\nOther experiments have documented a strong relation between acoustic transmissivity and fault strength [Dieterich and Kilgore, 1994; Kame et al., 2014; Nagata et al., 2008, 2012], or elastic wave velocities and the evolution of rock damage [Schubnel et al., 2006].",
      "We explored the stability transition in detail and found that it occurred consistently within a very narrow range of normal stresses, between 13.0 and 13.\n5 MPa, consistent with previous work [Leeman et al., 2016].\nEach of our experiments included 200+ slip events (Figure 7) and we measured the effective stiffness k\u2019ev from each loading curve following a slip event.",
      "We thus do not believe this situation arises in our study since we focus on highly similar sources.\nRecent laboratory study on slow earthquakes behaviors show that the duration of such events depends on the effective stiffness of the fault [Leeman et al., 2016].\nAnother explanation of the difference in slipping extension is the variation of stress state with time.",
      "Past laboratory studies of friction along granular, clay-rich fault zones, and rocks have been instrumental in providing a better understanding of the physics of friction and the occurrence of earthquakes.\nLaboratory stick-slip studies are considered as analogs of earthquakes and have been studied extensively [e.g., Brace and Berlese, 1966; Scholz et al., 1972; Stesky et al., 1974; Byerlee and Summers, 1975; Johnson and Scholz, 1976; Dieterich, 1978, Okubo and Dieterich, 1984; Ohnaka and Kuwahara, 1990; Sobolev et al., 1993; Savage and Marone, 2007; Johnson et al., 2008; Hedayat et al., 2014a, 2014b; Leeman et al., 2016].\nSeveral types of mechanical instabilities have been proposed as likely mechanisms for earthquakes.",
      "2017b).\nThe mechanical parameter that characterizes fault behavior is the shear stiffness of the fault (Leeman et al.\u00a02016; Kocharyan et al.\u00a02017a).\nAcoustic emission method is widely used in investigating internal evolution processes of laboratory faults.",
      "1999; Dragoni and Tallarico 2016).\nThe slow earthquake mechanism, in which the episodic tremor recorded by weak seismic signals accompanies the slow slip on faults, has also been proposed (Amoruso et al.\u00a02004; Shelly et al.\u00a02011; Ikari et al.\u00a02013; Crampin et al.\u00a02015; Leeman et al.\u00a02016).\nTremor and slow stick slip are induced by minor variations in stress from the ocean or solid earth tides, showing that changes in stress significantly influence the slow earthquake mechanism (Houston 2015).",
      "Changes occur in the stress applied to rocks in the earth\u2019s crust due to the geological tectonic development induced by different factors (e.g., ocean or solid earth tides), which influence the slow earthquake mechanism.\nThis mechanism, in which the episodic tremor recorded by weak seismic signals accompanies slow slip on faults, has been presented in a number of studies (Shelly et al.\u00a02011; Crampin et al.\u00a02015; Leeman et al.\u00a02016).\nTremor and slow stick slip are caused by minor stress variations from the ocean or solid earth tides (Houston 2015).",
      "Araki et al.\u00a0, 2017) are thought to occur at the transitional boundary from stable to unstable sliding expressed as k/kc \u2248 1 (e.g.\nGu et al., 1984; Leeman et al., 2016).\nSome studies suggest that the critical slip distance (Dc ) decreases with increasing shear localization (Marone and Kilgore, 1993), which reduces the minimum patch size that must be reached before instability.",
      "In case of VS, the matrix is stably creeping in the absence of external stress perturbation, and is also capable of hosting aseismic transient slip through either SSEs or afterslip, if subject to stress perturbation caused by, e.g., nearby earthquakes or transient pore fluid pressure elevation (Khoshmanesh and Shirzaei, 2018a; Perfettini and Ampuero, 2008).\nA small negative a \u2212 b, in combination with elevated fluid pressure, has also been suggested to be a favorable condition for SSE (Leeman et al., 2016; Liu and Rice, 2007).\nThe condition required for aseismic transients is also met if the a \u2212b of background matrix has a slip-rate-dependent behavior, being less VW (Kaproth and Marone, 2013; Shibazaki and Iio, 2003) or VS (Fukuda et al., 2013; Sawai et al., 2017) with increasing loading rate.",
      "5, S7).\nThis observation suggests a higher propensity for stick-slip behavior with increasing strain during cataclasis, which may be corroborated by recent experiments (Leeman et al., 2016; Scuderi et al., 2017).\nAn additional difference between log-normal and powerlaw particle-size distributions is that the former exhibit considerably fewer ultra-fine particles, which are generally better sorted (i.e."

      "Zeolites are extensively used in various industrial applications: gas separation, catalysis, ion exchange, water and air purification [9,10].\nThey are significant materials in biotechnology and medicine [11,12].\nZeolites have so far been used in the delivery of such drugs as: aspirin, 5- fluorouracil, diclofenac, doxorubicin, gentamycin, however, they have not been used as a carrier for bisphosphonates [13-16].",

      "The industrial catalytic application of A4 zeolite has been focused on the dehydration of ethanol [21].\nMany reactions at lab scale have been studied using LTA zeolites such as: selective catalytic reduction of NOx and NH3 [22], biodiesel production, oxidation reactions, decomposition of nitrous oxide (N2O), preferential oxidation of methanol over RuO2/LTA [23, 24].\nAdditionally, LTA zeolites (3A and 5A) have been recognized as very efficient sorbents of the organic pollutant 2-nitrophenol due to the interaction with OH- group from the molecule with the silanol groups presented in the zeolite surface [25].",
      "However, the different size of silver nanoparticles and position of silver clusters will lead to diversity of luminescence stability.\nIt is well-known that the luminescent Ag3 n+ clusters frequently generate at double 6-ring (D6r) cages of Ag-loaded FAUY zeolites during high calcination, which is luminescence stable [11].\nWhile the luminescent silver species in this study are believed to locate outside of the cavity of FAUY zeolite, implying that they are not stable enough and their luminescence is liable to be affected.",

      "Preventing progression from arthralgia to arthritis: targeting the right patients",
      "Other biomarkers or early clinical symptoms may serve as additional input into the risk stratification.\nFurthermore, it has been suggested that the early identification of RA patients, or the identification of arthralgia patients that are at high risk of developing RA is important for effective treatment of RA(49-51).\nThe combination of these three autoantibodies may help in to identify these high-risk patients.",
      "ACPA-IgG represents the most relevant prognostic and diagnostic biomarker in RA and is associated with poor prognosis and progressive joint destruction [21].\nA large body of evidence indicates that early intervention in RA improves clinical outcomes [22, 23].\nBased on these observations, it is hypothesized that intervention at a stage prior to the onset of clinically detectable arthritis may achieve even better clinical outcomes, and possibly even disease prevention [22].",
      "A large body of evidence indicates that early intervention in RA improves clinical outcomes [22, 23].\nBased on these observations, it is hypothesized that intervention at a stage prior to the onset of clinically detectable arthritis may achieve even better clinical outcomes, and possibly even disease prevention [22].\nCurrently, this preclinical phase is identified based on the presence of suggestive joint symptoms such as arthralgia, the detection of RA associated autoantibodies, especially ACPA, or both.",
      "Currently, this preclinical phase is identified based on the presence of suggestive joint symptoms such as arthralgia, the detection of RA associated autoantibodies, especially ACPA, or both.\nImaging studies indicate that this clinical phenotype may also feature subclinical synovitis [22, 24].\nAlthough arthralgia in conjunction with a broad autoantibody response is a strong predictor of imminent onset of RA, a linear progression towards these features has been difficult to demonstrate [25].",
      "Although ACPA has a high specificity for RA, the predictive value depends on the setting and the prior risk of RA.\nThis is a general principle and also applies to ACPA (IgG) as shown in Table 2 [48].\nACPA testing in the general population is not efficient.",
      "However, the knowledge that autoantibodies precede the clinical onset of these diseases offers an opportunity to intervene, if relevant autoantibodies are detected and preventative therapies were known to be effective.\nExamples of such interventions might include the use of hydroxychloroquine and rituximab, given their potential benefit in forestalling the clinical onset of lupus [102] and rheumatoid arthritis [103,104].\nHormonal manipulation is also a possible therapeutic intervention for this group of presymptomatic patients, although clinical trials of dehydroepiandrosterone in established SS did not meet their primary outcomes [105e107], possibly because of the failure of systemic administration to increase local salivary androgen output [108].",
      "Although activation of Th1 cells and altered expression of downstream genes like NFAT are thought to play key roles in RA [21], many other pathways have been implicated.\nFor example, one study from synovium showed that secreted phosphoprotein 1 correlated with multiple inflammatory genes, including T cell activation and apoptosis, while another study from synovium implicated a JAK/STAT-dependent gene regulatory network in RA [22,23].\nA study of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) implicated many different pathways, such as CTLA4 signaling in cytotoxic T lymphocytes, B cell development, phospholipase C signaling, calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis and aminoacryl tRNA biosynthesis in RA, while a study of CD4+ T cells from patients with RA showed abnormal functional of STAT3 signaling and Wnt signaling [24,25].",
      "Thus, there is a considerable demand for alternative therapeutic strategies as well as optimising those available at present.\nRA is a common complex disease derived from the interplay between genetic and environmental factors [3,4].\nKnown risk factors include periodontal disease [5], smoking [4], diet [6] and hormone fluctuation \u2013 the disease is more prevalent in women [5\u20137].",
      "Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 9 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1336 The current paradigm of RA management holds that disease is better controlled when very early DMARD treatment is established (55).\nNew lines of research indicate that early treatment of patients is associated with better disease outcomes (56); however, the clinical spectrum of RA is very heterogeneous and the discovery of new severity biomarkers will be needed to establish tailored treatments.\nOur data suggest that measuring SOCS1 mRNA levels could be a technically reliable and robust procedure with which to predict those patients who will have a poorer clinical evolution.",
      "Therefore, it was suggested that by combining the cytokine profile with the autoantibody status of RA patients, it may help improve the early detection of the disease [18\u201320].\nFurther methods of detection of RA include testing the erthrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, which are correlated with severity of RA and their presence can indicate disease progression [5,17,21].\nAlong with other risk factors mentioned in the introduction, such as heritability, smoking and viral risks, the presence of these RA-associated antibodies and chemokines can increase the probability of the disease developing."

      "This peri-luminal DOT1L staining pattern is reminiscent of that exhibited by the histone acetylation reader BRD4, another pro-IH epigenetic factor, as we recently reported [11,12].\nIn accordance, functional inter-dependence of BRD4 and DOT1L was recently discovered in cancer cell lines where H3K79me2 facilitated histone H4 acetylation which in turn recruited BRD4 [23].\nMoreover, synergistic effects resulted from small-molecule inhibition of BRD4 and DOT1L, both clinical trial targets for leukemia therapy [25].",
      "BET proteins bind acetylated histones and recruit protein complexes to regulate transcription initiation and elongation.\nThe mechanism of action of BET inhibitors is rather cytostatic than cytotoxic, therefore the working hypothesis is that these inhibitors will work best when combined with other therapies [9-15] We have previously reported preclinical data on our PLK inhibitor volasertib (BI 6727) as single agent and in combination with established and emerging AML drugs, including the antimetabolite cytarabine, hypomethylating agents like decitabine and azacitidine or the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib [16, 17].\nVolasertib has been tested in clinical trials, either in monotherapy or in combination with low dose cytarabine (LDAC) in AML patients [18-20].",
      "First encouraging data on clinical efficacy have been reported [33-35] Nevertheless, based on the critical role of BET proteins in transcriptional regulation, which may result in a rather small safety window, and the assumption that resistance towards BET inhibition may develop [36, 37] it seems warranted to explore promising combination therapies.\nRecently, combined genetic disruption or small molecule inhibition of BET and DOT1L have shown marked synergistic activity in leukemia cell lines, AML patient samples and mouse leukemia models [13].\nHere we discuss the efficacy of the new BET inhibitor BI 894999 and provide preclinical evidence for the excellent synergy of BET inhibition with the PLK inhibitor volasertib in AML.",
      "In MLL-AF4 cells, P300 is bound to the BCL-2 enhancer, and loss of MLL-AF4 results in loss of both H3K79me3 in the gene body and H3K27Ac at the enhancer.\nIt has recently been observed that on treatment with DOT1L inhibitors, H3K79 methylation loss is followed by a loss of P300 binding at gene targets [59].\nAlong with our data here, this suggests a link between MLL-AF4 activity, H3K79Me2/3 in the gene body, and P300 activity at enhancers.",
      "In AML, for example, BRD4 inhibition leads to the eviction of the Mediator complex from a subset of SEs involved in the regulation of key leukemogenic genes, leading to tumor growth inhibition [76].\nIn MLL, the disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L)-mediated methylation of histone H3K79 promotes histone H4 acetylation to positively regulate BRD4 binding at SEs [79].\nDual inhibition of DOT1L and BRD4 leads to a synergistic blockade of leukemia cell growth and proliferation [79].",

      "The case of BRD4 is remarkable in that it appears to affect the maintenance of a wide range of cancers.\nHowever, several successful preclinical studies focused on inhibition of other chromatin-related proteins in specific cancer types have confirmed the therapeutic value of targeting epigenetic regulators and have laid the foundation for ongoing clinical trials [57,60,73] (Table 1).\nAs with any therapeutic strategy, epigenetic modulation of CSCs faces challenges.",

      "HDAC or DNMT inhibitors individually extended the overall survival (OS) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients, but treatment with both drugs did not further improve OS [81].\nSynergistic therapies of BET inhibitor with DOT1L inhibitor [82] achieved preliminary success in preclinical studies, providing a solid experimental foundation for future clinical trials of combination therapies [45].\nMechanically, DOT1L and BRD4 exhibit functional collaboration, and DOT1L facilitates histone H4 acetylation through dimethylated histone H3K79, which in turn regulates the binding of BRD4 to chromatin."

      "Each bee harbors a unique combination of strains, indicating that the functional repertoire of the gut community varies across bees even within the same hive [20].\nDistinct behavioral groups characterized by division of labor coexist within the hive, and these show differences in gut microbiota composition and structure [58-60].\nThis system therefore represents a unique opportunity to understand how gut bacterial diversity affects variation in individual cognition and behavior and how the cumulative effect of these microbe-host interactions shapes the colony\u2019s social network structure.",
      "Moreover, it has also been reported that honey bee gut microbiota is shaped by seasons (i.e., diapause), landscape, and host genetic background [55\u201361].\nBee workers that survive over the winter harbor in their guts higher loads and less diverse bacteria affected by their diet during this period [59].\nSurprisingly, whereas beekeeping has been widely promoted as a tool to mitigate poverty in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, no comprehensive studies of honey bee gut microbiota have been done in these regions, where there are no pronounced seasons, and pollen/nectar resources are present all year long [1,6].",

      "Second, even if one were to determine all genetic variation, the downstream effect on protein functionality may be unknown and therefore impossible to interpret clinically [60].\nHowever, progress in the interpretation of functional consequences of such uncharacterized variations may support future interpretation in silico [61], in vitro, or in vivo [62].\nImportantly, a study has shown that 92.9% of genetic variation in ADME genes is rare, and an estimated 30% to 40% of functional variability in pharmacogenes can be attributed to these variants [63].",
      "Because many ADME genes are only poorly conserved, steps have been taken to calibrate in silico models on data sets.\nFor example, recently investigators developed a novel computational functionality prediction model optimized for pharmacogenetic assessments, which substantially outperformed standard algorithms [62].\nNonetheless, these models still do not enable prediction of the functionality of synonymous mutations, intronic variants, or variants in noncoding regions of the genome.",
      "We had to exclude some published benchmark studies.\nThe dataset for pharmacogenetics variants (68) was too small for reliable estimation.\nThe paper for compensated variants (53) did not share the disease-related variants, and thus could not be evaluated.",
      "However, functional characterisation of these variants remains challenging, with most being classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS).\nMost computational tools for predicting the function of exonic variants were calibrated on variants associated with disease and rely on evolutionary conservatism, yet many pharmacogenes are poorly conserved [128].\nThus, a new optimised computational framework that integrates several algorithms has recently been developed and validated using experimental activity data from 337 variants in 43 pharmacogenes, and was shown to significantly outperform existing bioinformatics prediction algorithms [128].",

      "We used in silico prediction algorithms that can distinguish deleterious from functionally neutral missense variants with relatively high confidence as judged by areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) between 0.8 and 0.95 for genome-wide analyses (Supplementary Table 2).\nHowever, for families of genes with low evolutionary pressure, the quality of predictions can be substantially lower (69).\nImportantly, we show that functionality scores for apolipoprotein variants were overall predictive for their effects on serum cholesterol levels despite complex linkage disequilibria, which might obscure functional effects (Supplementary Figure 2).",
      "To address this, experimental data were used to optimize available algorithms for functionality prediction of pharmacogenetic variants, resulting in an ADME-optimized prediction framework.\nPredictions for neutral and loss-of-function variants within ADME genes improved from 84% accuracy achieved by CADD, the best predictor among currently available algorithms, to 93% accuracy by the ADME-optimized framework [63].\nWe recently applied the ADME-optimized algorithm to score pharmacogenetic variants of interest and compared these with observed functional data [72].",

      "Secondly, NGS based sequencing is not able to make a firm assignment of the functionality of mutations identified, with respect to loss of function mutations and true synonymous mutations.\nHowever, relatively accurate algorithms to predict the functionality of mutations have been developed and trained on DME genes (28); the analysis workflow using such sequencing-based techniques is depicted in Figure 1.\nIn the future, the application of such a broad personalized approach for analyses of genetic variation could make pharmacogenomic predictions much more attainable for individual patients."

      "Quantifying climate feedbacks in polar regions",
      "However, other processes have also been found to contribute substantially.\nThe lapse rate feedback, which arises from vertical variations in atmospheric temperature changes and acts as a positive feedback in the Arctic and a negative feedback in lower latitudes, has been found in some studies to be the largest contributor to Arctic polar amplification (Goosse et al., 2018; Pithan & Mauritsen, 2014; Stuecker et al., 2018).\nThe nonlinearity of the Planck feedback, which describes how warmer temperatures lead to more outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) due to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, causes there to be greater warming in cold high-latitude regions for the same increase in OLR and has also been found to be one of the main feedbacks contributing to polar amplification.",
      "These changes in OHT are largely consistent among GCMs, with a robust decrease in northward OHT in the midlatitudes associated with a weakened overturning circulation, and a robust increase in OHT around 60\u201380\u25e6 N (Hwang et al., 2011; Nummelin et al., 2017; van der Linden et al., 2019).\nSome studies of transient warming in GCMs have found that the ocean contributes to Arctic warming through this increased high-latitude OHT (Holland & Bitz, 2003; Mahlstein & Knutti, 2011) while other studies have found that the net effect of changes in OHT and ocean heat content opposes Arctic warming (Goosse et al., 2018; Pithan & Mauritsen, 2014).\nNummelin et al.",
      "All simulations in this study were run to approximate equilibrium, and the caveat should be noted that transient climates could behave differently.\nIn an equilibrium state, ocean heat uptake is zero, but in a transient state, some studies have found that increases in ocean heat uptake oppose polar amplification (Goosse et al., 2018; Pithan & Mauritsen, 2014).\nAlthough the model presented here is focused on Arctic regions where the lower layer represents AW, the proposed mechanism could apply to any warm water mass resting below ice.",
      "Based on the differences in radiative fluxes, which are closely related to clouds, we examine differences in the Arctic shortwave feedbacks north of 70\u00b0N to investigate their impact on the difference in mean sea ice state in the CESM2 configurations.\nOf particular interest are (1) the positive shortwave surface feedback in which melting ice and snow lower surface albedo, increasing surface shortwave absorption; and (2) shortwave cloud feedbacks, including the negative shortwave cloud feedback that results from increases in liquid water resulting in higher cloud albedo and decreasing surface shortwave absorption (Goosse et al., 2018).\nWe evaluate these feedbacks using the approximate partial radiative perturbation (APRP) method (Taylor et al., 2007).",
      "This two\u2010way interaction between the clouds and the sea ice constitutes a feedback process (Klaus et al., 2016).\nUnderstanding how this feedback operates is required for a better understanding of the Arctic weather and climate (Curry et al., 1996; Goosse et al., 2018; Overland et al., 2016).\nRecently, the winter season has attracted more attention from Arctic researchers due to the accelerated wintertime surface warming since the late 1990s along with the decline of sea\u2010ice concentrations especially over the Atlantic sector of the Arctic Ocean (Comiso, 2006; Francis & Hunter, 2007).",
      "Note, when Arctic mean feedbacks are analyzed, the feedback parameters retrieved in the Arctic are still normalised by the global mean surface temperature and not the Arctic mean temperature.\nThis is done for two reasons, first, in order to scale regional radiation changes which makes them quantitatively comparable, and secondly, because local feedback parameters are not coupled to local temperature changes only but are also connected to remote changes via advective processes (Goosse et al., 2018).\nFor the Planck feedback, this yields kPL, polar \u00bc DRPL, polarDTglobal \u00bc DTpolar DTglobal 4erT3ctrl, polar (4) From Equation 4 we can see, that both the polar amplification factor as well as the base-state surface temperatures play a role for the strength of Arctic Planck feedback.",
      "Some studies have proposed that upward heat flux from an ice-free ocean warms the Arctic [10] and hence the prior-autumn Arctic sea ice exerts cross-seasonal influences on subsequent-winter circulations, which induce Atmosphere 2020, 11, 612; doi:10.3390/atmos11060612 www.mdpi.com/journal/atmosphere stationary Rossby wave train propagation [11], the impact of which on the occurrence of East Asian snowstorms [12,13] leads to cooling of midlatitudes [14\u201317].\nHowever, the influence of sea ice is still under discussion [6,9,18,19].\nBecause there has been an enormous reduction in Barents\u2013Kara Sea ice since 2007, it should have been cold every winter, which has not been the case [19].",
      "Francis [9] has suggested that sea ice is not the Arctic amplification; some other factors, such as water vapor, clouds, and stratosphere, which could change the atmospheric radiation and circulation, must be considered.\nGoosse [18] has suggested that the stable stratification conditions result in a larger lapse rate in high latitude than the tropic area, leading to a smaller increase of outgoing long-wave radiation, and thus accelerate Arctic amplification.\nHowever, Planck effects indicate that higher temperature increases longwave radiation which impedes Arctic warming.",
      "\nThe magnitude of this Arctic amplification is driven by several mechanisms that accentuate or dampen the direct impacts of radiative forcing (Goosse et al., 2018).\nThese feedbacks include increases in heat absorption by an expanding area of ice-free waters (Screen & Simmonds, 2010), and weakening of poleward heat transport by the North Atlantic Current due to freshwater input from melting ice (Thornalley et al., 2018).",
      "\nThe relative importance of these feedback mechanisms, however, has been under debate (Lu and Cai, 2011; Screen et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2013; Goose et al., 2018; Stuecker et al., 2018).\nStudied have suggested that changes in the large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation and related heat and freshwater transports also contribute to the Arctic Amplification and \u00a92020 American Geophysical Union."

      "Furthermore, the emergent constraint approach implicitly assumes that all other GCM characteristics relevant for \u03bb except the present-day climate system variable are unbiased and complete, and to the extent that this is not the case, predictions could be biased (Klein and Hall, 2015).\nFinally, when compared with the individual feedback approach, the emergent constraint approach appears less rigorous given the general lack of verified mechanisms and relative indirectness of the relationship between the present-day climate system variable and a highly integrated quantity like the total climate feedback parameter \u03bb which is dependent on multiple feedbacks (Klein and Hall, 2015; Hall et al., 2019).\n(This is less of a concern for emergent constraints for individual climate feedbacks.)",
      "Mechanisms have been identified that could link climate sensitivity to the rate of change of global\u2010mean precipitation (Mauritsen & Stevens, 2015; Watanabe et al., 2018), and so this change in climate sensitivity should prompt a reassessment of precipitation change.\nThe new set of simulations can also serve as an out\u2010of\u2010sample test for emergent constraints (Hall et al., 2019; Schlund et al., 2020).\nEquilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS; the equilibrium surface temperature response to doubling atmospheric CO2 concentration) increased on average from CMIP5 to CMIP6, with many more models above the assessed 4.5\u00b0C upper bound of the likely range (Collins et al., 2013).",
      "Simulation differences in parameterisation or format encourage new analyses and measurement campaigns that advance understanding.\nIn climate change research, the popular use of the technique of Emergent Constraints to reduce inter-ESM differences actually relies on a spread of projections by climate model ensembles (Hall et al., 2019).\nSpecifically, Emergent Constraints use regression to relate the spread in estimation of a quantity of relevance to future climatic states for raised atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to a quantity that is measured for the contemporary period.",
      "This aspect is presently not well understood and requires further study.\nThe EC framework is widely promoted as observationbased evaluation tool for climate projections, especially in the context of the nascent CMIP6 ensemble (Eyring et al., 2019; Hall et al., 2019).\nPrevious EC studies, however, exclusively focused on predictor\u2013predictand combinations that exhibit so-called existent ECs (Hall et al., 2019); i.e., the predictor and predictand are found to relate linearly across the ensemble.",
      "\nHall et al.\u00a0[3] relate this to a Douglas Adams-like \u2018emergent constraint paradox\u2019\u2014emergent constraints will cease to exist as soon as model developers start to take them seriously (such that they begin to tune their models to satisfy emergent constraints).\nThere are dangers associated with the emergent constraint approach as most effectively pointed out by Caldwell et al.",
      "\nTo guard further against spurious constraints, Hall et al.\u00a0[3] also propose a hypothesis-driven approach to testing for emergent constraints.\nThis involves hypothesising a relationship between an observable trend or variation of the system and a projected future change and then checking that relationship across the model ensemble."

      "Improving the sustainability of food production systems, while also reducing associated GHG emissions, is a major global challenge (IPCC, 2019).\nNitrous oxide (N2O), is a potent GHG, with the tropospheric concentration continuing to increase (Thompson et al., 2019; Makowski, 2019).\nAnthropogenic soil N2O emissions are governed by the rate and form of N applied as well as other biotic and abiotic factors, such as microbial community composition and activity, soil texture, and climatic conditions (Braker and Conrad, 2011; Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013).",
      "Meanwhile, in the last quarter of the twentieth century, two global\u2010scale environmental issues, namely stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change, became increasingly recognized, and the contribution of nitrous oxide (N2O) to these two global issues was identified (Crutzen, 1970; Ehhalt et al., 2001).\nConsequently, quantifying N budgets, including N2O, on a global scale has become of interest to both scientists and policy makers (Bouwman, Beusen, et al., 2013; Crutzen et al., 2008; Davidson, 2009; IPCC, 2006; Thompson et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019; UNEP, 2013).\nIn the recent decade, studies on planetary boundaries further highlighted the importance of quantifying N and P budgets on a global scale, as human impacts on N and P cycles have surpassed the proposed boundaries (Rockstrom et al., 2009; Steffen et al., 2015).",

      "Accordingly, there are two main consequences of the HFD-feeding: IR, which might be more linked to a decreased response to insulin in the muscle (that would affect both groups of mice to the same extent), and a hampered hepatic control of glucose homeostasis, which seems to be more dependent on obesity-associated inflammation, which appears attenuated in LysM-GRK2+/\u2212 mice, along with an improved hepatic insulin response and decreased steatosis.\nIn this regard, innate immunity is considered a major contributor to the pathophysiology of NAFLD, and there is strong evidence for the involvement of macrophages in the development of hepatic steatosis and inflammation [10].\nSeveral studies suggest direct associations between adipose tissue and hepatic inflammation [54].",
      "This fat-liver axis is considered to explain that, during obesity, the polarization of liver macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype is not the only important phenomenon for the development of NAFLD.\nRather, WAT macrophages, especially those in the visceral compartment, may contribute to the development of hepatic IR and hepatosteatosis through their effects on chronic inflammation [10].\nIndeed, the liver is the organ more exposed to cytokines released from visceral fat tissue, since these can be directly secreted into the portal vein of obese subjects to directly reach the liver [57].",
      "Thus, it is tempting to postulate that such decreased inflammatory pattern in WAT would relate to a decreased input of inflammatory cytokines to the 1 3 liver, in turn reducing activation of resident Kupffer cells and subsequent recruitment of macrophages to the liver in LysM-GRK2+/\u2212 mice, resulting in overall protection from IR and steatosis and preserved overall metabolic homeostasis.\nIn this regard, during a HFD, Kupffer cells are activated and initiate inflammation through the production of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and chemoattractants, helping recruit neutrophils and circulating monocytes, which rapidly acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype and further promote NAFLD progression [10].\nAccordingly, the protection from hepatic steatosis that we find in LysM-GRK2+/\u2212 mice is accompanied by a decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as by a decreased presence of macrophages within the liver."

      "Determining whether observed cloud changes are attributable to aerosol or meteorological factors is a major challenge (Gryspeerdt et al., 2016; Stevens & Feingold, 2009).\nTo better constrain causality, there has been a growing literature on \u201cnatural experiments\u201d like volcanic eruptions and inadvertent anthropogenic modifications like ship tracks (Malavelle et al., 2017; Toll et al., 2019).\nA clear signal in aerosol and cloud properties due to the February 2020 shutdown would be of great interest to those working to constrain the magnitude of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI).",

      "The lack of process studies in deep boundary layers, despite their prominence, motivates us to explore the dependence of cloud adjustments on BL depth.\nThis is further supported by recent findings that show an explicit dependence of the LWP adjustment on BL depth in pollution tracks (Toll et al., 2019).\nHere, we focus on regions dominated by marine stratocumulus, and we explore these relationships within 10- year records in the subtropics.",

      "Measurements were taken at three successive 48-h intervals at 100 days of differentiation and again at day 200.\nWe have previously characterised A\u03b2 profiles through neuronal differentiation and day 100 represents a timepoint when neurogenesis is largely complete and a neuronal A\u03b2 secretome is detectable [35].\nSecreted A\u03b243, A\u03b242, A\u03b240, and A\u03b238 did not correlate to levels of cell death.",
      "These cell-type differences might also determine variability in the relevance of APP as a CAM in neuronal migration.\nIn this context, it has been described different pattern of expression and processing of APP during cortical neuronal maturation and differentiation (Bergstrom et al.\u00a02016).\nAlso, a variety of studies have reported different subcellular distribution and processing of APP between neuronal and non-neuronal cells (reviewed by (Brunholz et al.",
      "These features have also been explored in sporadic patient-derived cells with varied results as some lines behave as fAD and some as control lines with respect to A\u03b2 secretion and tau phosphorylation [64, 67].\nThe majority of these studies have been based on cortical differentiation protocols, necessitating long differentiation periods as APP expression and A\u03b2 peptides progressively increase from 30 days of differentiation to mature cultures at 100 days [63, 71, 77].\nIn addition to monogenic fAD models, APP dosage models have been shown to demonstrate similar changes in APP processing to patients with APP duplication [64, 78] and Down\u2019s syndrome (trisomy of chromosome 21 on which APP resides) [65, 74].",
      "We found that although there were similar levels of APP expression in both models expressing APPSw,Ind for 12 weeks, it was not possible to match exactly the A\u03b2 expression levels in developmental-onset and mature-onset mice; A\u03b240 levels were seven fold and A\u03b242 levels were twenty fold higher in developmental-onset mice.\nThese results add support to the evidence for differences in APP processing mechanisms between the neonatal and adult brain [8].\nImportantly, the inducible line 102 model provided a gradual increase of A\u03b2 at physiologically relevant concentrations which are within the pM range observed in postmortem AD brain tissue [39, 40].",
      "In our hands, inhibition of -secretase processing of A PP at the plasma membrane by TAPI-1 increased the levels of the A PP carboxyl-terminal fragment ( -CTF) potentially providing more substrate availability to BACE1 within the trans-Golgi network.\nAmyloidogenic processing of A PP is associated with the appearance of mature differentiated cortical phenotypes in human iPS cells [42], and we observed similar -secretase favored processing of human A PP-GAL4 in mouse cortical neurons differentiated from E15 embryos, giving us confidence in the basic utility of a system expressing human A PP695 on a rodent background.\nSignificantly, mutations in A PP, such as the K670N/M671L mutation which enhances BACE processing, showed the highest levels of A PP-GAL4 mediated gene expression and greatest sensitivity to -secretase inhibition compared with wild type A PP and other A PP mutants.",

      "Actually, it is often arbitrarily chosen, as is typically seen in haloperidol being administered between the lowest dose (0.\n05mg/kg) and the highest dose (5mg/kg) (Morais et al., 2017; Halim et al., 2004).\nTherefore, in this study we decided the dose regimen according to the previous studies shown to be effective both in behavior and biochemistry (Centonze et al., 2004; Bi et al., 2009; Li et al., 2004; Halim et al., 2004; Kodama et al., 2004; Wakade et al., 2002).",
      "AC CE PT ED M AN US CR IP T To integrate positive and negative experiences over time, markers should not just be long- lasting, but positive and negative experiences should also be able to (at least partially) cancel each other out.\nOther experimental studies in animal models have indeed shown that the hippocampal biomarkers reflect the net effect of combinations of events that provoke affective states of opposite valence within the same individuals (Kim et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017; Morais et al., 2017).\nIt should therefore definitely be possible to assess cumulative affective experience if we restrict ourselves to measuring changes in hippocampal biomarkers over short periods (a few months).",
      "The familiar and novel objects were 16 cm high, being too heavy to be displaced by the animals and having a different shape, color, and texture.\nThe discrimination index (discrimination index = (novel \u2212 familiar / novel + familiar)) was used to assess the recognition memory as indicated in previous studies [19, 29].\nTo evaluate possible changes in locomotor activity, we also measured the distance traveled by the animals during the habituation session of the NOR test.",
      "Thus, adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus has been reported to be involved in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression (Duman, 2004; Samuels and Hen, 2011; Santarelli et al., 2003; Schoenfeld and Gould, 2012), schizophrenia (Flagstad et al., 2005; Keilhoff et al., 2004; Pieper et al., 2005), and cognitive deficits with neurodegenerative diseases (Marlatt and Lucassen, 2010; Mu and Gage, 2011; Vivar, 2015).\nSeveral rodent studies have indicated that chronic treatment with atypical antipsychotic agents, but not typical antipsychotics, leads to the stimulation of cell proliferation, survival, and neurogenesis in the hippocampal SGZ (Chen et al., 2013; Chikama et al., 2017; Halim et al., 2004; Kodama et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2005; Morais et al., 2017; Wakade et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2006; Xue et al., 2017).\nHowever, little has been studied on the presence/absence of these regional differences in the positive effects of atypical antipsychotics on adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",
      "Indeed, several studies reported that chronic administration of QTP results in an increase in the cognitive performance of rodents (Amin et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2014; Nikiforuk, 2013) and in the alleviation of cognitive deficit in schizophrenic patients (D\u00e9sam\u00e9ricq et al., 2014; Keefe et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013).\nMany previous studies have demonstrated that chronic treatment of atypical antipsychotics including QTP, leads to the increases in cell proliferation, survival, and neurogenesis in the total hippocampal DG (Chen et al., 2013; Chikama et al., 2017; Halim et al., 2004; Kodama et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2005; Morais et al., 2017; Wakade et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2006; Xue et al., 2017).\nAs far as we know, this is the first study to show the regional differences in positive effects of atypical antipsychotics on cell proliferation and neuroblasts/immature neurons between dorsal and ventral hippocampus.",
      "Alzheimer\u2019s disease and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and depression,may also be viable therapeutic candidates, as a significant decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis is observed in these disorders (Hamilton et al., 2015).\nStress and depression have been shown to reduce hippocampal neurogenesis, and the recovery of neurogenesis by antidepressant treatment is required for behavioral improvements in animal models (Morais et al., 2017), suggesting that targeting of the p38 MAPK pathway may show utility in the treatment of depression, especially in aged patients.\nFor the discovery of new drug candidates that facilitate adult neurogenesis in the aged brain, identifying direct downstream targets of the p38 MAPK pathway in the regulation of NPC proliferation is a key process.",
      "(2015) convincingly demonstrated that increasing hippocampal neurogenesis through a transgenic mouse line reversed a CORTinduced depressive phenotype, suggesting that neurogenesis per se does play a contributing role in antidepressant responses.\nMoreover, when considering neurogenesis, one should focus not only on the number of newborn neurons, but also on the maturation of those neurons, including the sprouting of dendritic arborization and integration of new neurons into mature circuits that seem to be dampened in depression and rescued by effective antidepressant treatment (Mateus-Pinheiro et al., 2013a,b; Alves et al., 2017; Morais et al., 2017).\nImportantly, our data indicate that peripheral etanercept administration works in rescuing not only the number of new neurons but also the maturation rate of hippocampal DCX-ir cells, and this could be one mechanism by which etanercept exerts an antidepressant action.",
      "The strength of this study is that all MDD patients enrolled were antidepressant-free.\nAntidepressant exposure alleviated the emotional disturbance and exerted a neurotrophic effect, including increased expression of neurotrophic factors and neuron remodeling (44, 45).\nAll antidepressant-free MDD patients in acute episodes with no interference from antidepressants are of great importance in identifying the primary white matter abnormalities.",
      "These effects were prevented by co-administration of the CB2 receptor antagonist AM630 (108).\nSimilar effects have been described after clozapine administration (172).\nIt remains to be further investigated if these CB2 receptormediated effects could play a role in schizophrenia by preventing stress-induced neuroplastic changes in susceptible individuals.",
      "Aripiprazole treatment increased neurite branches in primary cortical neurons derived from mice with dopamine D2 receptor hyperactivity and disrupter in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) [19].\nClozapine treatment in male Wistar rats subjected to chronic mild stress upregulated adult neurogenesis and neuronal survival, reversing the behavioural effects of chronic stress [20].\nQuetiapine augmentation treatment increased hippocampal cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation and improved depressive-like behaviours in treated rats [21]."

      "As a standalone step the process allows the isolation of [4] in an 80% yield (Figure 3).\nAn analysis of [4] was undertaken using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to gain insight into the morphology of the material prepared and to determine if the process was a true trituration or a crystallisation.\nMicroscopy of samples prepared under standard recrystallization techniques (Figure 4 A) and using our trituration approach (Figure 4 B) show clear differences.",
      "In stages 1 and 2 the use of the in-line triturator effectively allowed us the freedom to both purify the products and perform solvent swaps.\nIn the case of the telescoped process the precipitated products [4] and [5] had to be dried in the triturator under vacuum prior to passage into the subsequent stages.\nOn the demonstration scale only a single cycle of operations was required for both triturations, however, it is anticipated that on a larger scale simple numbering up of the triturators would allow continuous supply of feedstocks between stages one, two and three.",
      "Similarly, a thermal quench rapidly cools the reaction mixture to effectively stop the reaction progression.\nInvestigators are increasingly using in-line analytical technologies (32), including online HPLC (43), mass spectrometry (MS) (44), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (45), ultraviolet-visible absorption (UV-Vis) (46), infrared (47, 48), and Raman (49) vibrational spectroscopies.\nEach technology offers specific advantages and limitations.",
      "We speculate that the reason for this lower conversion could be inefficient removal of the in situ generated ethylene during the reaction.\nSince metathesis is an equilibrium process, ethylene removal is necessary to obtain complete conversion to products in many ring-closing or cross-metathesis reactions [25, 26].\nWe also analyzed the Ru leaching by ICP-MS analysis of the crude product and showed that 6.1 % of the charged catalyst leached into the product phase in the continuous-flow process.",
      "\nWe argue that the process of scientific discovery can always be thought of as a search problem, regardless of the nature of that discovery [7, 23, 24].\nMolecular discovery is a search within \u201cchemical space\u201d [25\u201328]\u2013an enormous combinatorial design space of theoretically-possible molecules."

      "In liver cirrhosis, elevated glucose levels and insulin intolerance are observed (Bezborodkina et al., 2014).\nPatients with NAFLD enrolled hyperinsulinemia which leads to increased lipogenesis from glucose; then, in the liver, fatty acids are excessively packaged, which causes hypertriglyceridemia (Vacca et al., 2015).\nIn diverse hepatic pathologies, the liver may go through many undesirable metabolic effects, such as excessive accumulation of triglycerides (Mollard et al., 2014), decreased glycogen synthesis and increased lipolysis and protein catabolism; these are some of the reasons why malnutrition is a common complication in liver disease.",
      "During the course of their life, many mammals must endure periods of limited food availability.\nThe body copes with fasting by mobilizing its energy reserves in a concerted multi-organ response [18,19].\nThe liver plays a central role in the metabolic adaptation to fasting, as it is a major site responsible for the supply of carbohydrates (glycogen hydrolysis and gluconeogenesis), for the processing of adipose-derived non-estrified fatty acids into a readily utilized energy substrates (ketogenesis), and for the catabolism of amino acids derived from skeletal muscle protein breakdown [19\u201321].",

      "In fact, increased levels of PPAR\u03b3 and SREBP-1c, both associated to the development of hepatic steatosis [29], were higher in control and HFD-fed male compared to female rats.\nIn contrast, PPAR\u03b1, which is known to promote fatty acid oxidation [30], was increased only in female rats in response to HFD feeding.\nAlong these lines, the SREBP1c/PPAR\u03b1 ratio, which has been used as an index of steatosis in liver [31], is significantly lower in female compared to male rats when both are fed a HFD (0.57 \u00b1 0.08 vs 0.95 \u00b1 0.13, P<0.05).",
      "Although a genetic predisposition has been highlighted, NAFLD is strongly associated with an unhealthy lifestyle and hypercaloric diet in the context of obesity and metabolic disease.\nThe deregulations of specific pathways (insulin signaling, mitochondrial function, and metabolism of fatty acids and lipoproteins) have been linked to steatosis (Vacca et al., 2015).\nIt was suggested that NAFLD is the typical hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome associated mainly with insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (Adams et al., 2005).",
      "350 If the degree of IR in the liver is less than that of the periphery, then the liver may be in a 351 state of relatively elevated insulin action thus inducing sterol regulatory element-binding 352 13 protein 1c (SREBP-1c), which i) promotes DNL, ii) negatively feeds back on insulin signaling 353 leading to decreased glycogen synthesis and increased gluconeogenesis, and iii) directly 354 promotes gluconeogenesis.\nThe net effect is thus the induction of NAFL and 355 hyperglycaemia (91), which is worsened by progressive hepatic fat accumulation and the 356 development of hepatic IR.\n357 Excess carbohydrate replenishes glycogen stocks, directly promotes DNL, and the 358 downstream products are channeled into DNL for the purpose of conversion into energy-359 dense fatty acids for long-term storage (92-94).",

      "These factors are important in the design of effective policies to reduce the burden of alcohol abuse and its deleterious effects on the liver.\nOther factors known to have an impact on alcohol intake at the population and individual level include: religious beliefs (28, 29), socioeconomic inequality (17), genetic factors (18, 30, 31), climate factors (14), concomitant addictions and mental diseases including posttraumatic stress disorder (32, 33).\nThese factors should be taken into account to measure the risk of ALD in a given country and also should be used to better design effective therapies by targeting at-risk populations.",

      "On the one hand, the metabolism of alcohol can produce abundant ROS, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hepatocytes.\nMoreover, the metabolite acetaldehyde can cause harmful adduct formation and induce genetic material transformation(Anstee et al., 2015).\nOn the other hand, alcohol can also increase intestinal permeability and alter gut microbial homeostasis, which facilitate the Gram-negative bacteria endotoxin LPS to access portal circulation and result in the activation of Kupffer cells, thus aggravating alcoholic liver injury (Mandrekar and Szabo, 2009).",
      "Here, we also observed that the mRNA levels of PNPLA3, a lipase associated with lipid droplet membranes and which shows nonspecific triglyceride hydrolase activity [43], increases after DZA treatment.\nGenome-wide association studies support a role of PNPLA3 as a modifier of ALD [44,45].\nBoth acute and chronic alcohol exposure increase liver PNPLA3 expression in association with elevated hepatic TG content, indicating that PNPLA3 has a lipogenic role [46].",

      "For example, in the study by Brasil et al., 7% of both the Zikaaffected and the Zika-unaffected pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortion or fetal death (Brasil et al., 2016).\nIn the study from Hoen and colleagues, 28 of 546 pregnancies (5%) were not carried to term or were stillborn, including 11 miscarriages, 10 pregnancy terminations for medical reasons, six stillbirths, and one pregnancy termination for nonmedical reasons; however, no comparison group was included in this study (Hoen et al., 2018).\nIn addition to the structural birth defects seen among offspring born to mothers with Zika virus infection during pregnancy, nonstructural abnormalities are also a consequence of prenatal Zika virus exposure.",
      "Unlike past health threats or unwanted pregnancy, the ZIKV epidemic brings a new set of variables into childbearing decision-making.\nZIKV might pose serious threats to adult well-being, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, but the risks to fetuses are more frequent and in most cases are more severe than those faced by adults (Ara\u00fajo et al.\u00a02017; Hoen et al.\u00a02018; Mier-y-Teran-Romero et al.\u00a02018).\nNewborns are confronted with the prospect of congenital defects, including brain abnormalities, and no chance of cure (Lin et al.",

      "One former study (Papadimitriou et al., 2016) presented impacts also for five selected river basins, and they are comparable with our results, except for the Rhine (where no statistically significant trends were found before).\nIn general, our results with the calibrated and validated regional-scale model are probably more credible for all selected eight basins, compared to the outputs of non-calibrated global-scale models often showing poor performance in the historical period (Hattermann et al., 2017; Krysanova et al., 2018).\nStill, the similarity of impacts is important, as the previous studies involved different types of models and climate change projections.",

      "Varying inputs and processes in a single model structure, such as SUMMA, could greatly advance our understanding of model performance beyond traditional MIPs and sensitivity analyses.\nRecent analyses indicate that regional models outperform global models based on streamflow simulation, attributed to global parameterization in most global models relative to basin-specific parameter adjustment in regional models [Krysanova et al., 2018].\nRegionalizing parameters of global models will become increasingly important for improving performance, as emphasized in many studies [Beck et al., 2017] [Bierkens, 2015] [D\u00f6ll et al., 2016].",

      "Therefore, we suggest to include more variables (e.g.\nLAI, evapotranspiration, snow, baseflow and hydrological signatures) to better constrain the calibration process which was also suggested by (Krysanova et al., 2018).\nLikewise, we suggest the use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms that search for acceptable trade-offs between objectives since these methods can help to mitigate the parameter uncertainty due to equifinality partly during the calibration.",
      "It is important to emphasize here that the above statements link the credibility of a model intended to assess climate change impact with the results of the model\u2019s evaluation against available (historical) observations.\nThis linkage, which seems quite natural to hydrologists, has recently provoked some lively discussions (see the review in [22]).\nThe accuracy of calculation of the observed runoff hydrographs with the help of calibrated and verified regional hydrological models is often not regarded as an argument in favor of their applicability for impact assessment (see, for example, [2, 36]), and is ironically compared to the ability to \u201ctesting how nicely a mathematical marionette can dance to a tune it has already heard\u201d [19]).",

      "EZH2 mutations can lead to a poor prognosis and shorter relapse-free survival in patients with AML [59\u201361].\nUNC1999 and OR-S1 (dual inhibitor for EZH1/2) displayed a significant decrease in clonogenic ability and an increase in cell death, differentiation of MLLAF9, and MLL-AF10 leukemic cells [145, 146] while EPZ6438 (EZH2 inhibitor) showed promising antileukemic activity with increased survival of AML1-ETO9a mice [147].\nDS3201b (oral EZH1/2 inhibitor) has entered the phase 1 trial for AML [148] (Table 3 and Fig.",
      "When Ezh2 was deleted before transformation with MLL-AF9 or AML1-ETO9a oncogenes, it accelerated AML progression and shortened survival, indicating a tumor suppressor role.\nIn contrast, when Ezh2 was deleted in secondary recipients during maintenance phase of AML, disease severity was attenuated and survival enhanced (30).\nOther members of the PRC2 complex including ASXL1, JARID2, and SUZ12 have also been implicated in the development of AML, with most of the mutations in these genes resulting in loss of function of the complex.",
      "However, it is also possible that those programs, necessary for disease initiation, are detrimental if expressed in later stages of disease and thus the activity of the same DUB is then detrimental for leukemia development.\nSimilar to USP7, these types of behaviors have been shown for other proteins, such as EZH2, which can act as a tumor suppressor during AML initiation and function as an oncogene at later stages of the disease [70].\nIn addition to its effect on MM and T-ALL, in vitro luminescent cell-viability assays have shown that the GNE-6640 and GNE-6776 USP7 inhibitors decrease the viability of AML cell lines relative to controls [14].",
      "Although DUBs seem to play an important role in tumor progression, there are systems where they display both oncogenic and antitumor properties, shown for USP9X in B-ALL [2,112\u2013115] and USP22 in AML [6,116].\nThis dual role suggests that the phenotypic outcome related to DUB activity might be dependent on the substrates present in a given cellular background, under specific stress conditions, or even at a certain cancer stage, as demonstrated for other enzymes, including epigenetic modulators such as members of the Polycomb complex in various AML settings [70].\nMoreover, we need to continue investigating and understanding ubiquitination signaling.",
      "Oncogenic gain-of-function mutations are found in patients with lymphoid malignancies [98]; in contrast, loss-of-function EZH2 mutations at diverse sites were detected in myeloid neoplasms [99, 100], including AML (0\u20132%) [75].\nFurther, derepression of stage-specific gene profiles induces polymorphic and contradictory phenotypes of EZH2 protein in different phases of AML [101, 102].\nDuring AML maintenance, wild-type EZH2 exerts an oncogenic function as a facilitator of disease that may be therapeutically targeted.",
      "6).\nThis result is consistent with previous reports that EZH2 can be either oncogenic or a tumor suppressor [31, 36, 37] and emphasizes the context-specific effects of EZH2.\nOur pan-cancer analysis also supports previous reports suggesting that polycomb activity may be commonly dysregulated in cancer [31] and may influence survival in a variety of cancers, with some cancers having a positive and others a negative association [31].",
      "The apparently conflicting functions of EZH2 in cancer may therefore simply reflect the antithetic roles that the protein plays at distinct stages of the disease: tumour suppressor during tumour-initiation, and tumour-promoter after cells transform and reprogramme their epigenome.\nOf note, recent findings support this model in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) as well [83].\nThus, the stage-specific role of EZH2 in cancer may be a widespread mechanism, which influences the evolution of both solid and haematological cancers.",
      "EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex and is involved in mono, di, and tri-methylation of H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me1/2/3), leading to chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression of target genes.\nActing both as oncogene and tumor suppressor, EZH2 plays contrasting roles in AML pathogenesis (Basheer et al., 2019).\nFrequently overexpressed in solid tumors, lymphomas (Morin et al., 2010) and in myeloid malignancies, EZH2 has a dual role: in fact, it can potentially act as a tumor suppressor, as suggested by a number of identified loss-of-function mutations (Nikoloski et al., 2010), or promote tumorigenesis and be linked to inferior patient outcome when overexpressed (Grubach et al., 2008; Nikoloski et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2011).",
      "It also a requirement in ES cells (43, 44) and induced pluripotent stem cells (45), and its interaction with the MYC oncogene may translate into AML.\nRecently, the methyl-transferase EZH2, a member of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that deposits the repressive H3K27me3 modification, has been characterized as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene in AML, depending on the stage of the disease (46).\nSpecifically, loss of EZH2 promotes AML initiation, reflected in low-frequency loss-of-function mutations in myeloid neoplasms (47\u201349), and the observed acceleration of AML transformation from premalignant myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (50, 51).",
      "\nThis hypothesis is further backed by a recent report describing opposite functions of EZH2 at early and late stages of disease: While EZH2 acts as a tumor suppressor at induction of oncogenesis, oncogenic properties are found to maintain the disease [41].\nThis observation also explains the use und usefulness of EZH2 inhibitors to suppress disease maintenance while reconstitution of EZH2 functionality at early stages, as suggested by our findings via targeting the OGT-EZH2 regulatory axis, may target the actual leukemia initiating clone."

      "A comprehensive analysis of rare genetic variation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the UK",
      "(2017) tested a panel of known ALS genes in a wide ALS population consisting of 1126 patients and 613 controls.\nThey found an increased burden of rare variants in patients within the untranslated regions of known disease-causing genes, driven by SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, VCP, OPTN, and UBQLN2 [65].\nMoreover, the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the noncoding region of C9ORF72 gene was shown to be the cause of 20\u201350% of familial ALS [66].",
      "Between 90 and 99.5% of individuals carrying the C9orf72 HRE will develop either ALS, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or both, suggesting strong penetrance [8].\nIn oligogenic ALS studies, a rare variant of unknown penetrance is often inherited with the C9orf72 HRE [9].\nIn the current study, we tested the necessity of multiple variants to cause ALS.",
      "Following the first descriptions of ALS, its pathological lesions were confined to the upper and lower motor neurons (loss of motor neurons and glial proliferation) [19].\nHowever, in autopsies of some ALS patients, especially FALS patients, degeneration of the posterior columns (in 50% of FALS cases, against only 10% of SAL cases) was reported [20], as well as degeneration of Clarke\u2019s column and the spinocerebellar tracts (rarely observed in AL at that time) [21].\nMoreover, some non-motor signs were observed in ALS since the end of the 19th century, such as cognitive impairment and frontotemporal dementia [22], even though the clinical entity \u2018AL with dementia (frontotemporal degeneration)\u2019 had not been clearly identified before the 1980s [23, 24].",
      "First, pathogenic mutations in genes not investigated in this study were previously reported in FTD/ALS patients with C9orf72 RE (van Blitterswijk et al 2012a; Giannoccaro et al, 2017).\nMoreover, how to establish a combination of mutations as pathogenic is arguable, as some variants of uncertain significance or defined as genetic modifier, benign, or neutral by the in silico tools, could have an important role when associated with a known pathogenic mutation (Morgan et al., 2017).\nIn this study, we used strict criteria to identify only variants that could be potentially pathogenic.",
      "Interestingly, in a previous study, we had identified the presence of M AN US CR IP T AC CE PT ED intermediate length repeat expansion in the ATXN2 gene in this sALS patient with the ANG mutation (Narain et al., 2017).\nThe pathogenic variants previously reported in the DAO gene include R199W, R199Q and Q201R (Morgan et al., 2017).\nWe observed the variant R199Q in a fALS patient.",
      "Also, the different definitions of pathogenicity and neutrality used in the different benchmark/training datasets could contribute to this effect (66).\nThe second is the difficulty that available computational tools have in assessing the effect of ALS related variants (3,36), in part because the mechanism of ALS is unknown, and in part because at least some of the variants result in a toxic gain of function that is difficult to understand or model.\nCorrelation analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between the 11 tools used by our score, using the categorical results of each individual tool on the VariBenchFiltered dataset.",
      "ALS Miseq and whole genome sequencing test cases Using DNAscan in Fast mode, we analysed real DNA sequence data from two ALS patients (case A and case B).\nCase A carries a non-synonymous mutation in the FUS gene [44] (variant C1561T, amino acid change R521C, variant dbSNP id rs121909670 [45]) known to be a cause of ALS (ClinVar id RCV000017611.\n25).",
      "While socioeconomic, cultural and environmental factors can differently contribute to the risk for AD, it is also unlikely in most if not all cases that a single LOAD risk SNP may be sufficient to drive progression to AD pathology.\nSuch an oligogenic basis of disease has already been described in patients presenting with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [164, 165].\nIn addition, the loss of VPS13C functioning in early-onset forms of Parkinson disease was recently detected to aggravate PINK1/ Parkin-dependent mitophagy [166].",
      "Their importance should not be disregarded, since they could underlie a significant portion of ALS cases, if taken together.\nOn the other side, specific variant types might exist, which are not commonly detectable by the currently used analysis methods, such as repeat expansions [152,153], variants in non-coding regions [154,155], and structural variants, which have been so far poorly explored in ALS [156].\nA further, major source of complexity in the genetic architecture of ALS comes from the suggested oligogenic model of inheritance, recently invoked by several studies and evidences [157,158].",
      "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, is the most frequent and severe disease within the widely heterogeneous spectrum of adult-onset motor neuron diseases (MND).\nIt is defined by the degeneration of both upper motor neurons (UMN) and lower motor neurons (LMN) in the cerebral cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord [1,2].\nThis leads to progressive muscle weakness, wasting, and rapidly progressive paralysis which typically causes death due to respiratory failure within three to five years after the symptom onset [1]."

      "Hypercoagulability causes atrial fibrosis and promotes atrial fibrillation",
      "Lastly, thromboembolic complications can be a result of a hypercoagulable state that is often found in AF [6].\nA hypercoagulable state can result both in stroke and atrial fibrosis through protease-activated receptor stimulation [7].\nDiabetes is a notorious risk factor for AF and affects multiple organs, as well as endothelial function.",
      "Interestingly, AF is associated with hypercoagulability, which may facilitate the development of embolic stroke.\nThe group further studied the effects of hypercoagulability on atrial fibrosis [34].\nThrombin, a major procoagulatory enzyme, activates protease-activated receptors in cardiac fibroblasts (PAR1), leading to profibrotic and proinflammatory responses in vitro.",
      "In transgenic mice with elevated thrombin activity, the induction and maintenance of AF is enhanced, pointing to an important role for hypercoagulability in the development of an AF-maintaining substrate.\nFinally, the inhibition of thrombin formation with nadoparin in a goat model of AF prevented the development of atrial fibrosis and reduced the complexity of the AF substrate, suggesting that drugs that inhibit thrombin or thrombus formation could potentially also prevent the development of AFmaintaining substrate in patients [34].\nThis question was addressed in a clinical trial on the effects of the oral anticoagulant edoxaban in patients with a high rate of atrial events detected with pacemaker or implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD; Non-vitamin K antagonist Oral anticoagulants in patients with Atrial High rate episodes \u2013 The Atrial Fibrillation NETwork [NOAHAFNET6], http://www.kompetenznetzvorhofflimmern.de/en/noah-afnet-6trial-can-oral-anticoagulation-preventstrokes-patients-ahre).",
      "Taken together, the available evidence on the effect of FXa inhibitors on cardiac function is in line with our observations and disputes their utility in chronic HF setting.\nThere are four PAR isoforms, but PAR1 and PAR2 are the predominant isoforms in the heart [13, 16].\nPAR1 is activated by thrombin and FXa, but PAR2 is only activated by FXa.",
      "Second, the activation of PARs in cultured cardiomyocytes induces pathological hypertrophy, reflected by increases in cell size and sarcomeric organization, the activation of the foetal gene program and perturbations in cardiac calcium handling [28].\nThird, PAR1 activation in cardiac fibroblasts induces a pro-fibrotic state reflected by enhanced proliferation and increased expression of transforming growth factor Beta (TGF-\u00df) [13, 28, 44].\nFourth, PAR1 activation is strongly proinflammatory as it induces the expression of interleukin (IL)6, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) [12, 13].",
      "Third, PAR1 activation in cardiac fibroblasts induces a pro-fibrotic state reflected by enhanced proliferation and increased expression of transforming growth factor Beta (TGF-\u00df) [13, 28, 44].\nFourth, PAR1 activation is strongly proinflammatory as it induces the expression of interleukin (IL)6, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) [12, 13].\nYet, the most robust evidence comes from studies in PAR1-knockout (KO) mice and mice with overexpressing the PAR1.",
      "Further, improvement of fibrosis can be supported by reduction in AKT phosphorylation as thrombin increases AKT phosphorylation in cardiac fibroblast via activation of PAR1, hence contributing to the pathological remodelling of the heart [11, 27, 31].\nInhibition of thrombin either directly through thrombin inhibitors or via its receptor using PAR1 antagonist in cardiac fibroblast has shown reduction in AKT phosphorylation and attenuation of fibrosis [31, 32].\nIn TUNEL staining, we observed that argatroban treatment reduced percentage of TUNEL-positive nuclei and caspase-3 expression suggesting the anti-apoptotic response of argatroban in diabetic animals.",

      "The potential protective effects of low and moderate alcohol intake on cardiovascular health has been studied for decades.\nModerate alcohol consumption lowered the morbidity and mortality risks from cardiovascular diseases, and led to more favorable cardiovascular health profiles [1,41].\nMoreover, although ethanol consumption was associated with an increased risk of AF, the attributable risk of ethanol consumption within recommended limits without acute excessive episode (binge) drinking was insignificant [42].",
      "A trend of heart rate increase following the exercise intervention has been detected, however no difference was shown between the ALC and the NO-ALC condition.\nThis conclusion raises different concerns since alcohol acts as a diuretic and it contributes to faster elimination of water content from the bloodstream, leading to increased viscous blood plasma which is harder to pump and deliver to the body tissues [31].\nThe heart has to adapt to these conditions to increase the cardiac output.",

      "The uninterrupted use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) periablation, in contrast, was not routinely recommended in guidelines until recently due to insufficient evidence from randomized studies (4).\nOver recent years, however, three randomized trials were published comparing uninterrupted anticoagulation with NOACs to VKAs in patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF: VENTURE-AF (5), RE-CIRCUIT (6), and AXAFA-AFNET 5 (7).\nThis review aims to provide an overview of the evidence from these randomized trials, and to contrast differences and similarities with regards to study design, patient population, and outcomes.",
      "In AXAFA-AFNET 5, 335 patients underwent brain MRI within 3 to 48 hours of ablation including diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery methodology.\nApproximately one-quarter of patients had an acute brain lesion detected by MRI within 48 hours of catheter ablation, despite a strategy of strict uninterrupted anticoagulation (7).\nThese findings suggest that some embolic mechanisms may not be preventable with anti-thrombotic therapy, such as air embolism, thermal thrombus related to radiofrequency delivery, or debris from ablation lesions.",
      "Certainly, this result can be predicted from the result of a recent multicenter randomized trial, FIRE AND ICE [4].\nMoreover, previous large trials also showed a similar rate of clinical complications between interrupted and uninterrupted DOAC use [8, 10, 11].\nHowever, a recent study regarding CB showed lower risks of clinical bleeding and ischemic events, but a higher incidence of silent cerebral ischemic lesion detection using an imaging study in patients who received interrupted DOAC therapy [31].",
      "Therefore, it may be important to evaluate subclinical ischemic brain damage beyond the clinical symptomatic feature and to assess the difference in potential risk of the anticoagulant regimen used during the catheter ablation procedure.\nUsually, silent ischemic stroke is evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination in the post-ablation procedure, and many studies reported finding a considerable number of silent ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance images [7, 9, 11, 31].\nIn the present study, we evaluated subclinical ischemic brain damage by focusing on the d-dimer level, a potential biomarker of thromboembolic events, as an alternative approach [18\u201320].",

      "The safety and efficacy of peri-ablation uninterrupted non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) therapy versus VKA have been studied in four randomized clinical trials.\nIn these trials, major bleeding and thromboembolic events were similar between uninterrupted warfarin and uninterrupted rivaroxaban (VENTURE-AF trial) [29], apixaban (AXAFA trial) [30], and edoxaban (ELIMINATE-AF trial) [31].\nHowever, in the RE-CIRCUIT trial, which compared uninterrupted dabigatran with warfarin, patients on uninterrupted dabigatran had fewer major bleeding events compared to the warfarin group (1.6% versus 6.9%, respectively) [27].",
      "However, the safety of NOACs as periprocedural anticoagulants remains unclear.\nSome studies [16, 18] suggested that uninterrupted VKAs were as safe as uninterrupted NOACs in patients with AF undergoing ablation.\nNevertheless, after several RCTs, such as the Evaluation of Edoxaban Compared With VKA in Subjects Undergoing Catheter Ablation of Nonvalvular Atrial Fibri l lat ion (VENTURE AF) [15] and the Randomized Evaluation of Dabigatran Etexilate Compared to Warfarin in Pulmonary Vein Ablation: Assessment of an Uninterrupted Periprocedural Anticoagulation Strategy (RECIRCUIT) [17] trials, in which uninterrupted rivaroxaban and dabigatran showed a non-inferior or superior outcome compared to uninterrupted VKAs in reducing bleeding complications, the 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLACE expert consensus statement recommends continuous dabigatran or rivaroxaban as a Class I indication [3].",
      "Furthermore, continuous anticoagulation does not prevent all acute brain lesions, which can be caused by debris from ablation lesions, air emboli, or small thrombi [22].\nThis was demonstrated by the MRI substudy of the AXAFA trial in which acute brain lesions occurred in 27% of patients despite uninterrupted apixaban [12].\nFurther research is required to establish the optimal NOAC dosing strategy (minimally interrupted or uninterrupted) with regard to both bleeding and thromboembolic risk.",
      "Limited data are available on the uninterrupted use of apixaban in patients with AF undergoing catheter ablation [9\u201314].\nThe anticoagulation with the direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban during AF CA: comparison to vitamin K antagonists therapy (AXAFA \u2013 AFNET 5) trial was an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open, blinded outcome assessment study [10].\nThis trial suggested that continuous apixaban is safe and effective in patients undergoing AF ablation and at risk of stroke with respect to bleeding, stroke, and cognitive function."

      "Only when a patient has provided written consent for the LSP, can a professional summary of the local pharmacy or GP EMR, including PGx results, be downloaded by another treating health care provider in the same region; unless the patient chose to shield this information.\nAlternatively, providing the PGx results directly to patients may resolve the issue in terms of communicating and recording PGx results; for example, utilizing the Medication Safety-Code card [37,38].\nIn the face of a time in which health care providers are confronted with an increasing number of variables to optimize clinical decision making, it is of utmost importance that this information is presented in a structured fashion; this is achieved by a clinical decision support system [39,40].",
      "For translation of the relevant genotypes to actionable PGx recommendations, guidelines of international experts are frequently invoked, such as the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) [8] or the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) [1].\nAs pre-emptive PGx testing is not yet routine in most clinics, several trials are currently evaluating cost-effectiveness and patient outcomes, including (i) the EU-funded PREPARE clinical study [9], in which microarray-based testing is used, enabling easy-to-use and platform-independent decision support by providing results on the Medication Safety Code system [10]; (ii) the CLIPMERGE PGx Program [11]; (iii) the eMERGE-PGx project [12], the latter two deploying PGRNseq [7], enabling the screening of selected pharmacogenes and integrating the results of PGx profiling into electronic health records (EHRs).\nNGS-based approaches have the advantage of additionally detecting novel (yet-unknown) and rare but pharmacogenetically-relevant variants, which may contribute to interindividual variability, allowing better PGx profiling and personalized medicine [13].",
      "For this, pharmacogenetically-relevant variants were extracted from WGS data and interpreted according to the quarterly-updated DPWG guidelines.\nSimilar to the PREPARE trial [9,10], our expanded pipeline outputs individualized treatment recommendations on a PGx report (Figure 1b) as well as on a PGx profile (Figure 1c) in credit card format (medication safety card, MSC), both of which can accordingly be used for better patient care.\nCurrently, our pipeline analyzes the most established 45 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels) in 11 genes as well as an HLA-B*5701 tagging variant and the deletion/duplication of CYP2D6, providing DPWG recommendations for 77+X (X = oral contraceptives) drugs (hereafter referred to as DPWG variants).",
      "It has been shown that targeted long-read sequencing of the CYP2D6 gene enables phasing and accurate calling of SNVs, indels, and SVs [30\u201332], which could be further evaluated using long-read WGS or hybrid assemblies of short and long reads.\nFourth, providing the PGx information as the MSC [10] or the recently developed \u201cPGx-Passport\u201d [33] in addition to a written report, if used correctly, allows platform-independent implementation of pharmacogenetics and patient autonomy.\nIn theory, by integrating information on individual PGx profiles for decision support of drug selection and dosage, ADE, costs, and time can be reduced, the extent of which is currently being investigated in the PREPARE trial [9].",
      "Secondly, the generalizability of these results for other healthcare settings and other countries may be limited due to differences in IT infrastructure, pharmacist responsibilities, HCP education, reimbursement policies, and patient attitudes.\nFor example, the healthcare IT system in the Netherlands is highly automated and advanced compared to other European countries [57].\nTherefore, countries with a less developed CDSS may experience other barriers specific to a panel-approach than reported here."

      "Despite promising benefits and a growing interest, widespread industrial implementation of biotechnology has been constrained by long development timelines and process economics due to the challenges of strain engineering [1].\nThe expansion of the DNA modification toolbox allows genetic editing in a targeted, rational manner, and this has generated a profusion of engineering strategies based on innovation in DNA synthesis and genome editing [2].\nYet the technology to investigate the resulting clones is often www.sciencedirect.com based on low-throughput, traditional analytics which cannot address the number of clones present in such diverse libraries.",
      "Additionally, the highly efficient and unbiased exchange, insertion or deletion of short segments (1\u20134 consecutive bases) is dependent on the inactivation of the native methyl-directed mismatch repair Current Opinion in Microbiology 2016, 33:113\u2013122 (MMR) machinery [2,22] which, in turn, can lead to the accumulation of undesired, off-target mutations [23].\nRecently, the specificity and ease-of-use of MAGE has been increased dramatically through the plasmid-based control of the host mismatch repair processes [24,25].\nThe pORTMAGE system [25] further extended the controllability of MMR processes by transferring all of the prerequisite components of MAGE to a broad-host vector.",
      "Although L-serine has the highest theoretical production yield from glucose of all amino acids, the actual yield that has been achieved through fermentation ranks among the lowest (Becker and Wittmann, 2012).\nL-serine is currently used in cosmetic and pharmaceuticals industries with an estimated annual demand of 400 tons (Leuchtenberger et al., 2005).\nAn efficient serine production strain could also be used as a platform for the production of ethanolamine and renewable ethylene glycol (Pereira et al., 2016).",
      "Although we managed to reduce the number of off-target mutations by 85% (18), modification of the parental strain was still a prerequisite.\nThis issue was also recently addressed by the so-called transient-mutator MAGE technique (19), which allows for flexible, plasmid-based modification of bacterial chromosomes.\nHowever, transient-mutator MAGE was only demonstrated to work in E. coli, therefore portability across species remained a formidable challenge.",
      "Finally, we introduced DNA adenine methyltransferase (dam) to the -Red operon of our strain.\nCo-induction of dam with the -Red recombination genes results in transient hypermutation via hypermethylation, which has been reported to enable incorporated mutations to evade MMR (33).\nTo remove a valine-sensitive growth defect present in E. coli K-12, we restored expression of ilvG.",

      "As mentioned, MMR machinery is known to interfere with the MAGE platform in various bacterial species, dampening final rates of mutagenesis.\nFor this reason, experimental setups aimed to facilitate deep genome engineering usually rely on permanent or transient suppression of MMR (Wang et al., 2009; Gallagher et al., 2014; Lennen et al., 2016; Nyerges et al., 2016).\nWe expect that implementation of the same approach in P. putida would greatly enhance Rec2 performance, facilitating for projects based on the deployment of high levels of combinatorial genomic diversity.",
      "In contrast, spontaneous mutation rates dropped significantly in the wild-type MMR-proficient background (to 1 spontaneous per 10 intended; 96, 99) (Figure 4a), whereas recombination efficiencies dropped as well.\nTransient or local MMR-deficiency can serve as a compromise to boost on-target editing without increasing the spontaneous mutation rate (74, 148).\nHowever, the most essential drawback of oligo recombination is that it is currently not practical for generating more than hundreds or thousands of mutations, limiting MAGE to recode only a few rare codons (113).",

      "In addition, preclinical RA stage is characterized by increased RF and ACPA binding strength (affinity/avidity) that, however, appears to be restricted to the phase preceding the onset of RAwithout further progress after diagnosis [33].\nAnother marker of the preclinical RA stage that shapes the antibody responses in individuals at risk of RA is epitope spreading, meaning the development of immune responses to epitopes distinct from the dominant epitope or even new antigens [30, 34].\nThe number of targets recognized by ACPA [35] and RF [36] increases in the years preceding clinical manifestation of RA, and this epitope spreading is associated with a higher risk of developing RA.",

      "A study exploring the effect of selective reduction of overnight slowwave sleep via an automated detection-intervention method in healthy volunteers also demonstrated increased CSF Ab levels in participants receiving the study intervention (Ju et al., 2017).\nHowever, in a recent study of partial sleep deprivation lasting 5\u20138 days, no changes in AD CSF biomarkers were noted, although that study did not alter the quantity of slow-wave sleep (Olsson et al., 2018).\nIn animal microdialysis experiments, interstitial fluid (ISF) Ab levels correlate with wakefulness and significantly increase following acute sleep deprivation or orexin infusion.",
      "This is particularly interesting given that the hippocampus is one of the most susceptible brain regions to AD pathology (Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018).\nOn the other hand, up to 8 nights of partial sleep deprivation, with slow wave sleep (SWS) maintained, have no effect on amyloid-\u03b2 CSF levels (Olsson et al., 2018), which lends support to the notion that SWS is critical for metabolite clearance.\nMore recent evidence has also correlated low heart rate and slow wave delta oscillations (1\u2212 4 Hz) to high glymphatic influx, which indicates that glymphatic function reaches its highest capacity during SWS (Hablitz et al., 2019).",
      "The multiple platform technique, which involves the loss of muscle tone during REM sleep episodes, has been demonstrated to completely suppress REM sleep (shown by the electrophysiological recording of the sleep deprived animals).\nHowever, it was reported that this technique also slightly reduces NREM sleep, but does not lead to rebound sleep (Machado et al., 2004).\nIt thus seems that this paradigm can predominantly produce PSD rather than elicit total sleep deprivation.",
      "Such observations can partly be explained by the findings of previous studies showing that estradiol reduces the homeostatic drive for REM sleep after SD (Hadjimarkou et al., 2008; Schwartz and Mong, 2011; Schwartz and Mong, 2013).\nThus, since REM sleep is mainly blocked in the multiplatform technique (Machado et al., 2004), in the absence of estradiol, the need for REM sleep is accumulated more efficiently in REM sleep-deprived OVX animals.\nOn the other hand, REM sleep is the most critical type of sleep in relation to sleep-dependent memory processing.",
      "Experimental REM sleep deprivation in animals increases orexin A in discrete brain regions [56].\nIn humans, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin concentration increased after several nights of experimental sleep restriction [57], further supporting its involvement in maintaining wakefulness.\nConversely, sleep fragmentation in atherosclerosis-prone mice has been recently shown to decrease expression of orexin in the hypothalamus, with a corresponding decrease of orexin A levels in plasma and bone marrow [58].",

      "More specifically, LP has emerged as a key tool in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease [1].\nWe have previously examined the link between partial sleep deprivation and biomarkers for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) in both CSF and plasma [2, 3].\nIn that research setting, with repeat LPs, we also observed a marked increase in several, but not all, brain biomarkers in the sample tapped at the second LP taken 3\u00a0 days later.",

      "Therefore, much of the selection imposed on thermal physiology during extreme events might be on the plasticity of those traits, rather than trait means per se.\nThat said, and while the current theory on all this is logical, the few experimental studies on climate-relevant traits provide little support for direct selection on plasticity [61,66].\nMost evidence for trait plasticity comes from laboratory studies in which organisms are held under a range of temperature or hydric regimes to generate reaction norms, and these studies increasingly incorporate environmental variability [67].",
      "To avoid extinction, organisms can move to new 51 habitats or adapt to the new conditions (Porcelli et al., 2015).\nBoth adaptive thermal 52 plasticity and genetic thermal adaptation may be solutions if populations remain in their 53 habitats of origin (Chevin and Hoffmann, 2017).\n54 Plasticity might allow a quicker response than evolutionary adaptation to 55 changing conditions (e.g.",

      "Aging is one of the most complex questions that biology has been trying to answer for years.\nToday, it became a priority in medicine due to the rapid increase of the elderly population and age-related diseases in Western countries [1].\nFrom the end of the 19th century the increase in human life expectancy has been the result of progress in hygiene, medical knowledge, and social-economic status; moreover, two other factors were of fundamental importance: the quality of lifestyle and nutrition [2].",
      "Autophagy may also exert life-shortening and life-extending effects at different times inC. elegans life history.\nReduced autophagy during development can impair health [40, 44], whereas late-life knockdown of autophagy genes can increase lifespan [41].\nEffects of autophagy knockdown on lifespan may also depend upon severity of knockdown.",
      "In fact, most mutations in autophagy and fat metabolism genes extended ARD survival, and these processes appear to be more important for AL lifespan.\nUnder AL conditions the role of autophagy is controversial as well, considering that late life autophagy is reportedly detrimental and knockdown of autophagy components in the nervous system can extend lifespan (Wilhelm et al., 2017).\nConceivably the unexpected increased survival conferred by loss of autophagy or fat metabolism genes in ARD, might on the other hand, compromise ARD recovery and reproductive output.",
      "These results uncovered a physiological role of the autophagy and proteostasis network in the maintenance of motoneuron-muscle.\nIn a parallel work, Wilhelm and colleagues found that silencing genes from the initial steps of the autophagy machinery in neurons, such as bec-1/BECN1, in adult worms promotes an enhancement of health and life span in aged animals compared to wild-type worms [19].\nInterestingly, they showed that the muscle and pharynx in aged C. elegans lacking bec-1 from adulthood maintain the youthful characteristics [19].",
      "With the later steps blocked, the permanent autophagy induction becomes an additional stressor for the cell.\nThus, the silencing of genes from the beginning of the pathway in neurons from adulthood, as evaluated in worms, relieves the pressure on a highly demanding and, in several cases, dysfunctional late-stage pathway [19].\nUsing the Atg7 cKO model, the authors then moved forward to assess the consequences of disruption of autophagy in experimental ALS.",
      "In concordance with these results obtained in HEK293T cells [32], we also find that motoneurons depleted of Pacer are impaired in their autophagy flux.\nIn the current literature, the dependence of motoneurons and the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) on autophagic activity is actively discussed [21, 72, 73].\nOn one hand due to the importance of autophagy in maintaining the high metabolic rate of motoneurons and on the other hand the requirement of motoneuron autophagy in preserving neuromuscular innervation [21].",
      "On one hand due to the importance of autophagy in maintaining the high metabolic rate of motoneurons and on the other hand the requirement of motoneuron autophagy in preserving neuromuscular innervation [21].\nMotoneurons have been shown to be extremely dependent on an efficient autophagy flux, referring to an accurate degradation of the formed autophagosomes in the lysosome [21, 72].\nFurthermore, during aging a progressive impairment of late endolysosomal processes is observed in neurons, resulting in increased cellular stress owing to the continuous input of new autophagosomes to cope with the turnover of organelles and other cargos (reviewed in [74, 75]).",
      "Cells, tissues and timing specific roles of autophagy also need to be considered.\nRecently and unexpectedly, neuron specific knockdown of autophagy after reproductive period has been shown to extend lifespan in worms (Wilhelm et al., 2017).\nThus, it is crucial to understand spatio- and temporal-regulation of autophagy and their physiological relevance to aging.",
      "Our results, together with previous studies reporting other microRNAs in DR-induced longevity, indicate microRNAs as effective regulators underlying this longevity program [37,38].\nInterestingly, although our results and previous reports indicate that a pha-4-mediated increase in autophagy in young adults is important for longevity [17,21], it was recently reported that the upregulated transcription of multiple autophagy genes by pha4 in aged worms promotes aging [39].\nWith aging, the formation of autophagosomes (APs) increases whereas that of autolysosomes (ALs) does not exhibit a similar change [40].",
      "8 of 14 EMBO reports e46888 | 2019 \u00aa 2019 The Authors genes in young animals, the effect of pha-4 in aged worms could be mainly in the APs, causing the incoordination between APs and ALs.\nConsistently, RNAi treatment against genes for APs (but not for ALs) in aged worms extends lifespan in a similar manner to pha-4 RNAi [39].\nThe mechanisms underlying the age-associated change in pha-4 downstream targets are interesting for future studies."

      "This task is exceedingly demanding since the system features nontrivial variability on a vast range of temporal and spatial scales and, furthermore, our ability to observe it has changed enormously over time.\nAdditionally, the presence of periodic as well as irregular fluctuations in the boundary conditions does not allow the climate to reach an exact steady state [10,11].\nOne of the features of the numerical investigation of the climate system is the reliance on hierarchies of models.",
      "Using mostly a plain language, we introduce here some theoretical aspects of climate dynamics that make it a topic of great interest for mathematicians and theoretical physicists, and try to convince the reader of the existence of a great potential for important results both at fundamental level and in terms of usable tools for studying specific problems associated with the understanding of the dynamics of the climate system.\nA more detailed exposition of the topics presented here (and of much more) can be found in a recent review paper [42]; see also [83] and [40,41].\n",

      "Additionally, data on the frequency of and the increase in risk of NAFLD for cardiovascular diseases and events in Germany are still lacking.\nPrevious studies that have used highly selected patients with histology-defined NAFLD in Germany likely overestimate the prevalence of CVD due to a selection and referral bias [18].\nTherefore, we explored a 7.49-million-case database of patients treated in primary care in Germany [19].",
      "Recent evidence indicating that 20\u00a0mg of atorvastatin seems to be safe even in patients with liver cirrhosis should give confidence in a therapy with statins in this population [10].\nHowever, in an analysis of 261 patients with biopsy-proven non-cirrhotic NAFLD, only 13% received statin therapy [11].\nThis is contrasted by the high cardiovascular risk profile these patients exhibited [12].",
      "This may have an important impact on the dementia risk, since fibrosis severity seems to be with markers of brain injury and cognition [15].\nUnfortunately, no data related to laboratory results and no surrogate scores for the presence of advanced fibrosis are available to separate patients with advanced fibrosis from those with earlier disease [28].\nFuture studies should be conducted to replicate or reject these findings and investigate the impact of disease stage on the development of dementia.",
      "Fatty liver was defined as a liver/spleen HU ratio < 1.0, and patients were assigned to categories of mild, moderate, or severe degrees of liver steatosis based on the two cut-off points of 0.5 and 0.7 [22].\nPrevious studies have demonstrated good validity in distinguishing advanced liver fibrosis based on NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) [23, 24].\nThe scoring system was calculated using the published formula: NFS = \u22121.675 + 0.037 \u00d7 age (years) + 0.0111 \u00d7 BMI + 1.13 \u00d7 impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or diabetes (yes = 1, no = 0) + 0.99 \u00d7 AST/ALT ratio \u2212 0.013 \u00d7 platelet (\u00d7 109/L) \u2212 0.66 \u00d7 albumin (g/dl).",
      "However, owing to a variety of modifiers, notably including gender, lifestyle, oxidative stress, insulin resistance (IR), lipidomic signature and genetic polymorphisms, a minority of these NAFLD individuals will develop nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is deemed to be the most powerful predictor of fibrotic evolution.\nLiver fibrosis, in its turn, dictates the natural course of hepatic disease spanning steatosis to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, liver failure, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [4].\nTogether with its hepatic manifestations and complications, however, NAFLD patients are also exposed to excess cardio-metabolic risk and extra-hepatic manifestations, which are probably also https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2019.02.028 Received 15 December 2018; Received in revised form 26 February 2019; Accepted 27 February 2019 Abbreviations: AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; ChREBP, carbohydrate response element binding protein; CVD, cardiovascular disease; CVR, cardiovascular risk; DILI, drug-induced liver injury; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FC, free cholesterol; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; HSCs, hepatic stellate cells; HVPG, hepatic venous pressure gradient; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; IR, insulin resistance; KLF2, Kr\u00fcppel-like Factor 2; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; LFA-1, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MetS, metabolic syndrome; NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; NASH, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; NF-kB, nuclear factor-kB; NO, nitric oxide; NgBR, Nogo-B receptor; PKA, protein kinase-A; Plin5, perilipin 5; PNPLA8, patatinlike phospholipase domain-containing enzyme 8; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; SREBPs, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins; TGF-\u03b21, transforming growth factor-\u03b21; TNF\u03b1, tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 \u2217 Corresponding author.",
      "In a recent mathematical model, the overall prevalence of NAFLD in Germany has been estimated to be 23%, including only 3.3 % of F3 and F4 patients (600,000 cases) (9).\nIn contrast, in an academic care cohort, F3 patients alone represented 16% of all cases (8).\nSince the referral rate of NAFLD patients from primary care physicians to specialists is largely unknown in Germany, our cohort may be biased towards more advanced disease as compared to the estimates from mathematical models but may still represent a broader NAFLD spectrum as compared to tertiary care settings.",
      "In fact, NASH-cirrhosis is thought to be the fastest growing indication for liver transplantation in the United States [7].\nAge imposes an additional risk factor for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis from NASH, as well as HCC [8, 9].\nIn this case, we report a 46-year-old patient with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes associated NASH, liver cirrhosis, and progression to HCC.",

      "Risk factors are age, sex (women are most affected), genetic factors, cranial lesions and Down syndrome.\nThe diagnosis of AD is currently based on clinical criteria, including neurological examination, mental status assessment and brain imaging tests [3].\nThese clinical tests unfortunately offer a low specificity, which is< 70% [4].",
      "For early diagnosis of AD and monitoring of AD evolution, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a central role as it reflects molecular events occurring in the brain [2, 3].\nWhile the 42-amino acid residues long amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2 1-42) in CSF has been used as an established biomarker [4-6], there is currently an emerging tendency to use combinations of various A\u03b2 isoforms to improve the differential diagnostic power between AD and healthy subjects or to discriminate better AD from other neurodegenerative diseases [7-11].\nThese biomarkers are measured in routine clinical practice using immunoassays [12].",
      "The limit of quantification achieved for a single A\u03b2 peptide was 0.05 nM with LIF detection, which lies within the concentration range (0.02 \u2013 0.\n2 nM) of A\u03b2 1-42 normally found in CSF [7, 8, 10, 11, 16].\nFurthermore, the same ITP process was also carried out on a mixture of 5 amyloid peptides (A\u03b2 1-42, A\u03b2 1-40, A\u03b2 1-38, A\u03b2 2-40, A\u03b2 5-40) with obtained peak heights quantitatively correlated to the total amyloid peptide concentrations (R = 0.9908 for a range of 0.05 \u2013 2 nM, see Fig.",

      "For example, increasing the cut-off value for CSF A\u03b242 positivity in CSF (possibly at the expense of reduced sensitivity) can increase concordance rates between PET and CSF by tipping over cases with borderline positive results [39].\nFurthermore, CSF A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 ratios can also improve concordance rates between CSF and PET, as this accounts for interindividual variability in A\u03b2 production, CSF turnover, or pre-analytical influences such as absorption [10, 40, 41].\nThe immunoassays that are being used might also explain some variance of discordance, as newer immunoassays show improved agreement between CSF and PET [42].",
      "The reference methods use mass spectrometry without antibody enrichment and have high sensitivity and specificity for detecting amyloid plaques (21\u201323).\nC12RMP1, which was developed at the University of Pennsylvania, uses solid-phase extraction coupled with LC-MS/MS (21), whereas C11RMP9, which was developed by RocheDiagnostics and theUniversityofGothenburg, uses isotope dilution mass spectrometry (22, 23).\nBoth assays have a wide linear range (from 100 to Fig.",

      "Current controversies in determining the main mechanisms of atrial fibrillation",
      "Electrogram morphology/local conduction properties For this approach, it is assumed that the local (bipolar) electrograms recorded during ongoing AF reflect electrophysiological phenomena that maintain AF: (functional) local conduction slowing, (functional) lines of block, short-lived micro-reentry, abrupt changes in conduction direction, shortening of the refractoryperiodandhigh-frequencyfiring of arrhythmogenic foci [2].\nAll these phenomena might be involved in the initiation, but also perpetuation, of AF and thus represent possible ablation targets [19].\nHistorically, the first technique to be used was a Fast-Fourier transform of local electrograms where the areas with the highest dominant frequency represented possible ablation targets [2, 20].",
      "In addition, it is well recognized that AF itself can also contribute to atrial fibrosis independent of the underlying cardiovascular conditions as listed above [34-36] It is also plausible that fibrosis could be a marker of progressive atrial cardiomyopathy from a myriad of other non-cardiac causes including genetics, drugs and inflammation [37].\nIn contrast, the entity of primary fibrotic atrial cardiomyopathy has been proposed to be responsible for the development of AF independent of underlying cardiac risk factors although its prevalence remains unknown [38, 39].\nThe discontinuity in atrial conduction due to atrial fibrosis may also contribute to AF perpetuation by favouring re-entry, preferential conduction and anchoring of AF drivers [40, 41].",
      "2015).\nSince the pathophysiological mechanisms causing and maintaining AF are still not completely understood (Schotten et al.\u00a02016), various types of noninvasive techniques have been developed for better understanding of the mechanisms.\nWith respect to the ECG, being the most well-established noninvasive technique, it is only until fairly recently that attention has been directed towards the atrial fibrillatory waves (f -waves) and their characterization (So\u0308rnmo et al.",
      "Even though catheter ablation has been widely used for AF, the treatment is invasive and remains inadequate in a significant number of patients and development of new anti-arrhythmic drugs for AF is highly desirable.\nBecause atrial and ventricular myocytes express distinct repertoires of ion channels, there has been considerable interest in developing atrial-specific ion channel blockers for atrial arrhythmias (Wettwer et al., 2007; Burashnikov et al., 2008; Antzelevitch & Burashnikov, 2010; Burashnikov & Antzelevitch, 2010; Schotten et al., 2016; Voigt & Dobrev, 2016).\nHowever, it is critical to note that the degree of atrial selectivity of anti-arrhythmic drugs may be different in normal, compared to remodeled, hearts associated with different cardiac diseases.",
      "Moreover, 20% of total strokes occur approximately in patients with this arrhythmia [3].\nHowever, pathophysiological mechanisms causing and maintaining AF are still not completely understood [9].\nThis fact makes its diagnosis and therapy extremely challenging and, often, poorly efficient [10].",
      "Their vast majority relies on quantifying the two significant alterations provoked by the arrhythmia on the ECG.\nBriefly, in contrast to sinus rhythm (SR), where the atria are contracted in response to a repetitive and synchronized electrical impulse originating at the sinus node, atrial contraction during AF is activated by very rapid and disorganized impulses generated at multiple locations [9].\nThis disorganized activation causes ineffective atrial contractions, such that the common P-waves in SR are replaced by irregular fibrillatory (\ud835\udc53-) waves during AF [21].",
      "This is just a portion of the entire atrial surface and using this technique a full view on all rotational activity in the atria cannot be achieved.\nHowever, there are 3 aspects of our epicardial mapping approach that strengthen our conclusions: (1) we used high-density mapping grids which provide more reliable analysis of conduction patterns than the often sparse set of points obtained using basket catheters, (2) the majority (101 out of 138) of PSs we found originated and disappeared within field of view suggesting that our conclusion regarding the short lifespan of PSs is reliable, (3) we mapped an area between pulmonary veins, which is often reported12 as a frequent location of stable PSs.\nYet, even in this area, PSs were short-lived and true rotation occurred in <1% of all fibrillation waves.",
      "More specifically, while increases in IK1 lead to stable mother rotors, reductions in ICa,L have the potential to cause spiral wave breakup and thus lead to multiple independent wavelets [70].\nThus, the two main hypotheses regarding AF mechanisms may be reconciled [71].\nFurthermore, a decrease in the number of sarcolemmal membrane invaginations - t-tubules - following abnormal cellular stretching, leads to electrical - mechanical uncoupling, not only adding to the contractile dysfunction, but, potentially, leading to arrhythmogenesis given that larger L-type calcium cur- rents are necessary in order to elicit calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, potentially depolarizing the cell in the process (afterdepolarization) [72].",
      "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most relevant cardiovascular challenges in western countries [1], affecting approximately 1.5\u20132% of the general population [2].\nAlthough it is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice [2], its mechanisms are not fully known [3, 4].\nThis fact makes diagnosis and treatment of the arrhythmia poorly effective and complex, thus demanding more research efforts [5].",
      "While considering gross anatomy and well-established atrial electrophysiology and structure, heterogeneous fibrosis distribution and transmural uncoupling are relevant factors that were intentionally neglected in this study.\nBoth these aspects are integral aspects of current hypotheses on AF mechanisms (Schotten et al., 2016) and can lead to spatially heterogeneous alterations of conductive and ionic properties.\nHowever, we chose to focus on studying the fundamental principles in a simple setting of homogeneous remodeling, first."

      "Similar to the acute group, in these patients, two different groups could be distinguished.\nThere were 45 patients with a decrease or a change in liver SWE of less than 10% (Figure 2E, Supplemental Table 3B), since this was the variance within measurements in the same patients in previous studies (13, 14).\nThese patients also showed a significant decrease in spleen SWE (Figure 2E Supplemental Table 3B), whereas 22 patients showed an increase of more than 10% in liver SWE seven days after TIPS and at the same time a significant decrease in spleen SWE (Figure 2F, Supplemental Table 3B).",

      "Using the SIMOA technology, several studies showed higher plasma tau levels in patients with neurological disorders compared to cognitively normal (NL) controls [9,15,17,18].\nThese results were promising, although they typically showed a relatively high degree of overlap in plasma tau concentrations between AD and controls and weak correlations of plasma tau with CSF total tau and P-tau levels in AD [19].\nLittle information is currently available on the value of adding plasma tau to CSF tau and CSF P-tau in AD biomarker panels in AD clinical studies.",
      "We are aware that elevated tau alone, both in plasma and CSF, cannot be considered a specific biomarker for AD.\nElevated tau levels have also been related to traumatic brain injury and postconcussive cognitive symptoms in both acute [19,40] and chronic traumatic brain injury [41] and to the effect of anesthesia and surgery [42].\nThis body of work highlights the potential validity of plasma tau as a measure of neurodegeneration, in agreement with our current data, which demonstrate a negative correlation between plasma tau and cognitive function (PARD).",
      "Despite the fact that p-tau is often proposed as more specific for AD [4], a higher diagnostic accuracy has been reported for t-tau than for p-tau in large pathologyproven cohorts (AUC 5 0.831 and 0.753 for t-tau and p-tau, respectively) [7] and in large meta-analysis Q[10].\nIt should be noted that t-tau and p-tau values are tightly correlated with each other in the context of AD [11], and that both biomarkers show a good correlation with neurofibrillary tangle load in pathologically proven cohorts [12].\nIn fact, t-tau has showed even higher correlation rates with the pathologic neurofibrillary load than p-tau (r 5 0.550 and 0.466 for t-tau and p-tau, respectively) ghts reserved.",

      "This likely reflects the fact that CSF p-tau is very closely related to the AD pathophysiological process, with CSF p-tau concentration levels correlating with neurofibrillary tangle pathology in AD patients (Buerger et al., 2006; Seppala et al., 2012).\nCSF t-tau levels, while significantly higher among AD-dementia patients than among cognitively normal individuals, can also be seen in other diseases and reflect more general levels of neuronal injury due to both AD and nonAD processes (Zetterberg, 2017).\nAdditionally, it has been hypothesized that CSF p-tau becomes abnormal earlier in the course of AD than CSF ttau (Jack et al., 2013), so that during the initial phases of the disease, abnormal levels of CSF A\u03b21\u201342 and p-tau may be more strongly associated with MTL atrophy than abnormal levels of CSF A\u03b21\u201342 and t-tau."

      "The SiB model was developed in the 080s and 090s with the aim of simulating the land\u2013atmosphere exchange of energy, water and carbon [35,36]).\nThe latest version (SiB4; [37]) integrates previous versions that improved model hydrology (SiB3; [36]), simulated carbon pools (SiBCASA; [38]) and simulated crop phenology (SiBcrop; [39]).\nThe SiB4 model differs from previous versions in the sense that it calculates plant phenology through a process-based model rather than using satellite products to describe the state of the vegetation.",
      "SiB4 simulates the leaf photosynthesis rate as a minimum of three limiting assimilation rates: that is, (1) limited by the capacity of the RuBisCo enzyme, (2) limited by light, and (3) limited by storage and export in the photosynthesis process [35,40,41].\nThe SiB4 model simulates different PFTs for specified areal fractions in each grid cell to include land cover heterogeneity [37].\nThe four most common PFTs used for Europe are: C3-grassland (GRA; non-Tundra), evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF), C3-cropland (CRO) and deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF), covering 14.9, 14.3, 13.8 and 11.9% of the land area, respectively, for the area between \u221215\u00b0E and 40\u00b0E longitude and 30\u00b0N and 70\u00b0N latitude.",
      "(d) Soil moisture response in Simple Biosphere model v.4 Previous work has shown that the carbon cycle drought response to soil moisture stress is often not well captured in biosphere models [21,23,45].\nWhile SiB4 already includes several improvements to the model hydrology and has been able to successfully capture drought stress in grassland PFTs over North America [37], we follow two additional strategies to improve the model\u2019s drought response.\nFirstly, modify the rooting depth in two PFTs to get a stronger expression of soil moisture stress.",
      "This is in contrast with the 2003 drought duringwhich the European land biosphere (4.6 \u00d7 106 km2) was estimated to be a source of carbon of 0.5 Pg C yr\u22121 [2].\nThis is even though the 2018 drought had a larger extent (24\u201338 Mha) compared to the 2003 drought (20\u201328 Mha) [37].\nThe greater impact on NEE in 2003 may be due to the very dry spring (from February) exacerbating the drought, while in 2018, a widespread soil water deficit is only apparent from April.",
      "In 2003, the reduction in carbon uptake was found to be due to a limitation of water, and not to extreme heat [3], which, given the strong temporal and spatial correlations of the NEE and SWC anomalies, appears to be the case also for 2018.\nThis is also consistent with conclusions drawn from global vegetation models investigating the drought [37].\nPersistent high-pressure systems, like that in 2018, may become more common in the future, particularly during the summer, due to a weakening mid-latitude circulation, which likely will lead to a greater occurrence of weather extremes and drought [38,39].",
      "Flux site data thus confirm that over a large region of Europe, 2018 was not a singular rain-deficient, warm, or sunny year, but showed a combination of these anomalies.\nAffected sites were located in central Europe north of the Alps, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe (figure 1b), in general agreement with other groundbased and remote sensing observations as well as models [21,23].\nIn particular, affected sites are well distributed across the region suffering the strongest annual reduction in the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI [24]).",

      "However, cross-species transmission must also have occurred during the evolution of hepatitis viruses.\nApart from the zoonotic HEV genotypes, examples of cross-species transmission events include hepatoviruses in marsupials that are of likely rodent origin [28], horse-associated hepaciviruses in dogs and donkeys [38, 41], gorillas infected with chimpanzee hepadnaviruses, orangutans infected with gibbon hepadnaviruses [97], and rat hepeviruses in shrews [171].\nIn addition, the tentative HBV genotype J likely emerged from a recombination event involving human- and gibbon-associated parental strains, hinting at cross-species virus transmission from gibbons to humans (summarized in [68]).",
      "Their important role as hosts for zoonotic pathogens has been linked to their species richness, abundance, worldwide distribution, the synanthropic behavior of some species, the ability of bats to fly, and to gregarious populations of some bat species [176, 178, 179].\nInterestingly, highly diversified homologues of HAV, HBV, HCV, and HEV were detected in these two mammalian orders [25, 28, 30, 42, 43, 54, 180, 181] (Figure 4), hinting at the importance of small mammals during hepatitis virus evolution.\nOne can assume that the diversity of viruses is highest in areas of prolonged circulation.",

      "High Zika Virus Seroprevalence in Salvador, Northeastern Brazil Limits the Potential for Further Outbreaks",
      "Virologic diagnosis usually requires both molecular detection and serologic detection of IgM and IgG antibodies, since viremia is usually low and transient [4].\nZIKV serologic diagnosis is mostly based on antibodies against two viral proteins, envelope and NS1 [5].\nThe envelope protein has critical roles in the assembly of virions and cell entry [6] and NS1 is a non-structural glycoprotein that plays a putative role in viral replication, and when secreted modulates viral immune invasion and pathogenesis [7].",
      "Later in 2007, ZIKV emerged in the Pacific island of Yap, in 2013 in French Polynesia and other Pacific islands and from there expanding to mainland Latin America in 2015 causing the biggest outbreak to date [10\u201312].\nThe limited serologic surveys that are available found a high-level population exposure reaching from 42% in French Polynesia and 49% in Martinique, to as much as 63% in mainland America, specifically Brazil [5, 13, 14].\nIf ZIKV confers long-lasting immunity, high exposure could create sufficient herd immunity limiting local resurgence and upcoming epidemics [5].",

      "No sample tested positive by RT-PCR.\nAlthough there was no RT-PCR confirmation of acute ZIKV infection, it is likely that ZIKV antibody responses are largely comparable between study participants, since all of them were likely infected in a very similar time span during 2015\u20132016, due to the ultra-rapid ZIKV spread in Salvador, northeastern Brazil [5].\nBrazil acquired millions of ZIKV NS1 antigen-based indirect ELISA tests (Euroimmun, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) for serological testing in public health laboratories [19].",
      "Brazil acquired millions of ZIKV NS1 antigen-based indirect ELISA tests (Euroimmun, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) for serological testing in public health laboratories [19].\nWe used the same NS1-based ELISA to compare detection between the paired serum samples from 2016 [5] and 2017\u20132018.\nThe ZIKV seropositivity in the first timepoint in 2016 reached 59.0% (85/144, 95% confidence interval (CI) 50.7\u201366.7%) in concordance with the 63% seroprevalence from a serologic survey performed at the UHPES in 2015\u20132016 (Fig.",
      "Similarly, DENV NS1-specific IgG antibodies were readily detected up to three years postinfection in Brazilian patients [20].\nThose data are not at odds with our results, because DENV seroprevalence is as high as 80% in northeastern Brazil [5] and individuals frequently have multiple DENV infections likely boosting NS1-specific immune responses compared to ZIKV, which exists as a single serotype.\nOur serologic data from Brazil are thus consistent with data from Pacific island populations in showing loss of ZIKV-specific antibody responses over a comparably short time span irrespective of the serologic method used for testing [24].",
      "2017).\nIn northeastern Brazil, serum studies identified Zika antibodies in nearly two-thirds of new mothers recruited to be controls in case-control studies in late 2015 and early 2016 (Araujo et al.\u00a02016; Netto et al.\u00a02017).\nWhat does this mean for expected changes in birth cohort size?",
      "2019).\nAt the population level, however, the fecundity effects in humans do not appear to be large enough to account for the majority of observed declines in Brazilian birth cohorts, even with rates of population infection that appear to have exceeded 50% in high risk areas (Araujo et al.\u00a02016; Netto et al.\u00a02017).\nWe see no evidence of declines in live births 7\u20138 months after the peak infection period; the declines 9\u201310 months after the peak infection period did not exceed 6% to 7%.",
      "Coordinated response efforts during the early stages of the Zika epidemic were ultimately contingent on countries detecting cases and reporting them to international health agencies (Lessler et al., 2016), primarily PAHO (PAHO, 2017a, 2017b).\nFor Zika virus and other Aedes aegypti mosquito-borne viruses\u2014 including dengue and chikungunya viruses\u2014that are primarily transmitted in urban settings and disproportionately impact those with limited resources (Braga et al., 2010; Gardner et al., 2018; Netto et al., 2017; Weaver et al., 2018), accurate local reporting is especially problematic.\nNot only are people in poor living conditions more likely to be exposed to infected mosquitoes, but such communities often have less access to adequate healthcare, resulting in more cases going undetected (Hotez, 2016; LaBeaud, 2008).",
      "Indeed, four local Zika cases were reported in Florida during 2017, linked to their partners having recently returned from Cuba (FL DOH, 2017a, 2017b, 2018).\nDespite these findings, however, beyond a few cases, no Zika outbreaks were reported in these 18 regions in 2017, perhaps due to existing herd immunity (Netto et al., 2017; Zambrana et al., 2018).\nThese results show the global connectedness of Zika endemic areas, and with Zika cases associated with travel from the Americas ongoing as of October 2018 (Figure 1), continued surveillance is required to detect potential further spread."

      "Presence of liver steatosis has been independently associated with atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction [6] and advanced fibrosis has been shown to be the major driver for long-term outcome and mortality [7].\nPrevious studies investigated hepatic histology in obese patients however NAFLD and NASH detection in this population is often challenging.[8, 9].\nIn fact, conventional tests based on ultrasound imaging are often difficult to perform in this class of obesity and serum markers have been developed in cohorts not including subjects with this high degree of obesity.",
      "There are not many studies in literature evaluating at the same time so many noninvasive biochemical and radiological methods to detect and stratify NAFLD and NASH in morbid obese subjects.\nHowever, this study has two important limitations: first the small sample size compared with previously published manuscripts, and the limited number of subjects having clinically relevant disease (NASH in 22 patients, with no patient with F3/F4 fibrosis) although also previous studies showed that prevalence of severe fibrosis in morbid obese is much lower that in subjects with BMI < 40 kg/m2 [9].\nMoreover, these numbers may appear to be low, but it should be underlined that in this special population validated data on noninvasive scores of NAFLD and NASH vs biopsy are still lacking.",
      "Though, prevalence is over 85% in morbid obese [4] and 75.6% in patients with T2D independent of obesity.\nThe prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been estimated to range 3\u20135% [1], but it can be more than 10 times higher (30-90%) in subjects with morbid obesity undergoing bariatric surgery [4, 6].\nOnly few studies have investigated glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity during OGTT in biopsy proven NAFLD and (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and none, to our knowledge, in subjects with morbid obesity.",
      "However, if this is true also in subjects with morbid obesity has not been investigated.\nSubjects with morbid obesity often have a lower degree of fibrosis [6] and the relationship among glucose tolerance, indexes of insulin sensitivity and severity of fibrosis and NAFLD might be different than in subjects with lower BMI.\nIn morbid obesity, adipose tissue function is still preserved and subcutaneous adipose tissue can expand becoming a buffer for excess circulating lipids, thus limiting the accumulation as ectopic fat [16].",
      "Bedossa et al shown that morbid obese subjects with presumably normal liver, have lower prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia than those with NAFLD/NASH and adipocyte size were increased in females while decreased in males.\nBut he did not evaluate the impact of IR on severity of NAFLD [6].\nIR is considered one main driver for NAFLD since high insulin concentrations stimulates adipogenesis and lipotoxicity [11].",
      "Other following studies reported a similar prevalence of NASH, i.e., Bedossa reported 35% [6] and Petrick 32%[29], while Lassailly a much lower prevalence (7.7%) [30].\nThe prevalence of NASH in our study was 24%, lower than Bedossa (35%) [6] or Petrick (32%) [29], but similar to Machado [4].\nAs expected, the degree of steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning was significantly different among the 3 groups observing the highest-grade cases in group with NASH.",
      "It is important to notice that patients without NAFLD and patients with SS or NASH had similar BMI, gender and age.\nThis suggests that in patients with morbid obesity the severity of liver damage depends not so much on the degree of obesity and BMI, as suggested by Bedossa et al[6], but rather on the degree of metabolic impairment and presence of comorbidities.\nIndeed, previous studies have not evaluated the association among severity of NAFLD, and so many OGTT derived IR-indices in morbid obesity.",
      "In our study, most patients were females so a possible role of the gender on NAFLD differences in morbid obesity could not be evaluated.\nIn our cohort serum liver enzymes, ALT and \u03b3-GT, although within normal ranges, increased significantly with the severity of liver disease, similar to Bedossa et al [6].\nElevated \u03b3-GT and ALT, although used often as markers of fatty liver disease, can be in the normal ranges also in NASH subjects [40, 41].",
      "In the last 40 years, the prevalence of severe obesity which globally affects 0.6% of men and 1.6% of women has tripled in men and doubled in women, worldwide (48).\nSeverely obese individuals are particularly prone to NAFLD and progressive liver disease: at least 80% will have some histological forms of NAFLD (49, 50).\nStudies evaluating liver biopsies collected during bariatric surgery show a high variability of histological findings and liver injury/fibrosis, which may either reflect different histological definitions of disease or truly heterogeneous patient populations.",
      "However, it is estimated that more than one third of these patients will have NASH, 40% some degree of liver fibrosis and 1.4% (1-7%) unexpected liver cirrhosis (49).\nThe degree of liver injury seems to depend on age and MetS components (49, 50).\nInterestingly, NAFLD is associated with older age, rather than with the duration of obesity."

      "The prevalence of NAFLD has increased considerably over the last years due to the current lifestyle (unhealthy diet and sedentarism) [4, 5].\nIt has been calculated that up to 30% of the population shows NAFLD, representing up to 70% in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [6].\nDespite the high prevalence of NAFLD, the vast majority of patients show simple steatosis, which is a benign condition, while a small percentage of them have NASH or liver fibrosis [7].",
      "Within the NAFLD spectrum, the prognosis of NAFL differs significantly from that of NASH, with no increase in liver-related mortality and minimal risk for disease progression.\nHowever, NASH with fibrosis progresses at a faster rate than NASH without fibrosis, with high risk of developing HCC, liver failure, and death [5, 6].\nAlthough evidence clearly supports the development of HCC in patients with NASH-cirrhosis, data now suggest that HCC can also occur in NASH patients without advanced fibrosis.",
      "The spectrum of disease progresses through highly dynamic histological stages that includes simple steatosis at one end and an inflammatory subtype at the other, in which the presence of inflammation and ballooning signifies the presence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\nThe latter can progress to fibrosis, sometimes resulting in the development of cirrhosis, to liver failure, and/or cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) [5, 6].\nHepatocellular cancer can also arise in the absence of cirrhosis.",

      "In order to achieve evidence-based and cost-effective use of MRI in the early detection of RA among patients presenting with UA, the optimal scan protocol needs to be examined.\nAn important issue in this respect is whether imaging of the foot is of additional value to the hand, as it prolongs the scan time and thereby costs [11].\nTwo studies have performed MRI of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints in UA patients, in addition to MRI of the wrists and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints [12, 13].",

      "Treatment is only up-scaled after 3 to 6 months of insufficient response to MTX, despite evidence supporting a \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 for targeted treatment [1, 17].\nThis window of opportunity is a limited period between diagnosis and RA progression in which the disease could still be modified, radiographic damage/functional disability could be limited, and progression could be slowed down upon early control of disease activity, for which sufficient treatment is required [17].\nOur prediction model could assist in identification of insufficient responders at diagnosis: for those with high probability of insufficient response to MTX, additional biologics or JAK inhibitors could be prescribed, while for patients with low probabilities of insufficient response these expensive treatments could be spared.",
      "Although it has become an accepted term and has been used in the literature, a formal definition of the term is lacking.\nIn a recent review of the literature on articles that used the term \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 in the context of RA, a significant heterogeneity on the timing of the window was observed [5].\nIn almost half of the articles identified in this review, no exact duration of the window of opportunity was included in the description.",
      "In some cases, the window was defined as a phase preceding structural damage [6,7].\nWhen a time definition was used, that could stretch from 2 years after disease onset to 12 weeks after symptom onset, with the year of publication being inversely proportional to the time from disease or symptom onset [5].\nBut what is the \u2018opportunity\u2019 referring to?",
      "While targeting a stringent goal such as remission, it almost ensures us of inhibition of radiographic damage and progression, it is not sure that the timing of the windows needed to achieve these two goals is identical.\nHowever, regardless of the outcomes discussed above that are used to define the window, evidence from both observational studies and randomised controlled trials shows that the window does exist, as if treatment is initiated during this early phase, irrespective of the exact time definition, it leads to less radiographic damage and disability [3,5] and has a higher chance of achieving remission.\nDefinitions for a standardised duration of the window of opportunity have been proposed [8].",
      "Current treatment options in this phase, despite being theoretically built on themodulation of biological processes relevant to RA pathogenesis, are hardly able to result in full disease control.\nObservational studies and randomised controlled trials, however, suggest that, even in its full-blown clinical picture, there might be a \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 in RA in which treatments are more likely to result in sustained control of inflammatory disease activity, eventually allowing tapering and even the suspension of medications [3,4].\nSuch clinical evidences raise the fascinating hypothesis that there might be a period in which the biological processes of RA are less mature and potentially more reversible.",
      "This \"treat-to-target\" approach, the target being remission, has been shown to have better clinical outcomes and better quality of life, and helps prevent further structural damage, functional disability and job loss (Combe et al., 2015; Smolen et al., 2017 Bernard Combe et al., 2017; Smolen et al., 2010, 2020).\nFor this review, patients were defined as being early RA if they were in their first 2 years of disease duration (Burgers et al., 2019; Luqmani et al., 2006).\nThese patients with early RA are monitored at rheumatology nurse-led clinics which run alongside rheumatologists\u2019 clinics (BSR & NRAS, 2019).",
      "In the past decade, there is an explosive surge in the number of biologic and targeted synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) approved for the treatment of RA.\nEvidence for the benefits of early treatment and the treat-to-target principle has been cumulating [3,4].\nAccording to an early RA registry initiated by the Hong Kong Society of Rheumatology (HKSR) Education and Research Foundation, RA patients with early disease treated with conventional DMARDs and the tight control principle, more than 70% could achieve disease remission or low The 2019 Updated Hong Kong Society of Rheumatology Consensus Statements for the Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis Chi Chiu Mok Department of Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital Tsing Chung Koon Rd, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong SAR, China ccmok2005@yahoo.com disease activity state at 1 year of follow-up [5].",
      "Furthermore, it has been shown that the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures, seen in a subset of patients with RA, is regulated by FAP-positive stromal cells, in a manner that is dependent upon the autocrine and paracrine production of IL-13 [12]\u2014 a cytokine we identified in the synovial fluid of patients with early RA.\nSince the publication of our initial findings in 2005, there has been increased focus on the earliest phases of RA including the stages preceding the onset of joint swelling [13].\nWhilst we were not able to study these, a clearer understanding of these earliest phases and how to define them [14\u201316] now opens the possibility of assessing when, during the natural history of RA, synovial pathology first develops and how this changes over time.",
      "At-risk individuals with subclinical inflammation are at increased risk of arthritis development.\nIt is therefore logical to suggest that this population should be considered for treatment, therefore should be included in the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d (2).\nOne of the many challenges is that arthritis development is a late step in a long process sometimes called \u201cthe inflammatory arthritis disease continuum\u201d (3), where the preclinical phase includes, genetic, environmental, and systemic factors which may arise years before arthritis occurs (4, 5).",
      "Importantly, GlycA levels were independently associated with therapy outcomes, even after adjusting by CRP levels and duration of symptoms, a major determinant of treatment response.\nAlthough the role of the \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 has been proposed, its exact delimitation is under debate [24].\nIt can be hypothesized that GlycA levels may assist in the identification of the window of opportunity, thus rethinking this concept from a pure calendar time to a more biological concept."

      "Accordingly, much research is now devoted to finding epigenetic alterations as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers to identify at-risk individuals and predict the success of drug therapy.\nIn addition, drugs targeting the epigenetic machinery can increase the success of conventional standard-of-care treatment and are gaining momentum particularly in the area of oncology [2].\nEpigenetic marks are reversible, tissue specific, and highly dynamic modifications, which requires the consideration of specific caveats regarding the planning, design, and execution of epigenetic analyses [3,4].",

      "Several nonviral and viral-based vectors are available for gene delivery.\nNonviral delivery systems, such as liposomes and oligonucleotides as carriers, possess certain advantages including easy synthesis, low production cost, and a favorable safety profile due to low host immunogenicity or insertional mutagenesis [3].\nHowever, transfection efficiency and durability of gene expression remain prominent challenges attributable to the physical barriers and obstacles to nuclear entry.",
      "AAV is the most promising vector due to the following features: (i) it has already been used as a viral vector for gene therapy of a number of diseases; (ii) it is capable of infecting both dividing and non dividing cells and efficiently incorpo rates into the host genome; (iii) it induces weak immune response and is not pathogenic for humans; (iv) it is not capable of replication and requires a helper virus (aden ovirus, as a rule) for propagation; (v) several AAV serotypes (AAV1 AAV9) have been recognized that bind to different cell receptors (thus, viruses of different serotypes have been used for the mouse and macaque reti nas); (vi) the safety and efficiency of AAV based vectors have been demonstrated in the gene therapy of the retina degenerative disease (Leber congenital amaurosis), which is very important for the optogenetic retinal prosthetics.\nThe recently published review [80] discusses in detail the vectors and techniques for gene delivery primarily to the primate retina, which is essential for the pre clinical trials using optogenetic prosthetics of the human degen erative (blind) retina.\nThe authors believe that AAV is the most suitable vector for the gene delivery to the retinal neurons.",
      "Additional serotypes with increased retinal transduction abilities have also been identified through either rational design or directed evolution [4,8].\nThis is one of the most attractive features of AAV vectors for retinal gene therapy, since alternative, both non-viral and viral, vectors tested thus far have shown more limited transduction abilities of adult photoreceptors [2,9].\nFor all the above described reasons, AAV have been used in many successful preclinical and clinical studies [3,4].",
      "Because of the localization of these receptors on target cells, the entry of certain rAAVs is facilitated over others.\nIn the retina, the cell-type specificity also depends on the injection route with intravitreal injections, bringing the rAAVs in contact with inner retinal cells and subretinal injections and facilitating vector access to the outer retinal cells [8,11].\nIn our hiPSC-derived organoids [12,13], laminated neural retina obtained after several weeks of differentiation displays photoreceptor precursors on the outside and ganglion cell precursors in the center of the structures.",
      "\nThere are two main versions of delivery of virus vectors (see Fig. 1, A): by injection into the vitreous humor of the eye (intravitreous) or by injection into the narrow cleft between the pigment epithelium layer and the photoreceptor layer of the retina (subretinal) [6, 59].\nThe choice of injection route depends mainly on the fi nal aim of prosthetization: the intravitreous route is preferred for delivery of transgenes into cells in the inner layers of the retina (ganglion and bipolar cells), while the subretinal route is more suitable for targeting cells in the outer layers (photoreceptors or pigment epithelium cells).",

      "First, effects of temporal and spatial resolution on the method implemented in this study, when using synthetic data, have been studied and revealed that up to 30 phases per cardiac cycle, strain changes remain reasonable [15].\nSecond, LA strain has been significantly associated to histological fibro-fatty infiltration in the LA myocardium [17].\nThis latter was performed on surgical LA myocardial samples excised for each patient after the MRI exam used for FT.",
      "With the advent of speckle tracking echocardiography and feature-tracking magnetic resonance imaging, quantification of left atrial strain and left atrial emptying fractions was made easy.\nBoth strain and emptying fractions are seen to be more closely associated with electrical abnormalities (7), left ventricular fibrosis and dysfunction (8), left atrial myopathy (9,10), and filling pressures (11).\nIn addition, they are also superior as prognostic indicators of incident AF (12\u201314), heart failure (15), cardiovascular events and stroke (16), and mortality (17) in the general population, stroke after catheter ablation in patients with AF (18), recurrence of AF (19), and post-stroke mortality (20).",

      "It is impossible with elastography to distinguish among these components with certainty.\nSpecific MR sequences, like T2 mapping and T1 rho, might be helpful in discriminating fibrosis from edema in the future [30, 31].\nOn the other hand, a composite of hepatic congestion and fibrosis measures might be important, clinically, in the longitudinal follow-up of Fontan liver disease [32].",

      "When Increasing an AGCM Resolution From ~ 100 to ~ 10 km in Midlatitudes?\nIncreasing atmospheric model resolution from low res to high res has been shown to improve the representation of largescale circulations in the midlatitudes: cyclones [26], the location and frequency of occurrence of blockings [26, 27], and the non-Gaussian nature of North-Atlantic weather regimes [28].\nIn addition, kinetic energy spectra have been used to show that additional contributions from smaller scales emerge when the resolution of AGCMs is increased [29\u201331].",
      "Since we define blocking as stationary high pressure at mid-latitudes following a classical definition (see section 2.2), we only consider cases northward of 50\u25e6N.\nBlocking can hence not have the above-mentioned direct effect for southern Europe (the effect of low-latitude atmospheric ridges on southern Europe is addressed in Sousa et al.\u00a0[2018]).\nTherefore, advection of cooler air from the north due to the anticyclonic motion of the block is most probably again the main driver of the strongly reduced HW frequency in southern Europe similar to the winter CS cases.",
      "That being said, the S2S models are initialized with ridging over eastern Europe in the composited difference LN-EN but fail to maintain it as in observations.\nWe cannot rule out the possibility that model deficiencies in, for example, the representation of blocking in this region (biases are present in CMIP5 models and persist even at high resolutions; Dunn-Sigouin & Son, 2013; Masato et al., 2013; Schiemann et al., 2017) may have led to the modeled rapid decay in height anomalies in this region; this possibility deserves future research, though a thorough investigation of blocking frequency and duration in S2S models, or of the effect of climate change on blocking in this region, is beyond the scope of this work.\nHowever, connections between ENSO and blocking in western Eurasia are weak (Cheung et al., 2012; Gollan & Greatbatch, 2017), and hence, even the ridging over western GARFINKEL ET AL.",
      "Only recently, substantial improvements, even eliminating frequency biases (Jung et al., 2012), have been achieved.\nOne of the most studied model characteristics known to impact atmospheric blocking representation is the atmospheric resolution, both in horizontal and vertical directions (Jung et al., 2012; Anstey et al., 2013; Schiemann et al., 2017).\nHorizontally it determines if small-scale eddies vital for the establishment and maintenance of blocking anticyclones are resolved (Shutts, 1983; Yamazaki and Itoh, 2012).",
      "In winter, CM simulations show a robust signal of impact of physical parameterizations and AM simulations are again simultaneously improved by finer resolution and updates to physical parameterizations.\nThe possibility of reducing biases in blocking representation through advances in atmospheric resolution and physical parameterization has been previously reported for AM simulations (e.g.\nBerner et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2012; Schiemann et al., 2017) but CM simulations, especially in a single-model framework, have been studied less (Anstey et al.\u00a0, 2013).",

      "\nThis highlights the role of different processes acting in Pacific versus European blocks, and it is possible for one to be improved in a model while the other degrades [107, 108].\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that blocking frequencies can still be fragile even in relatively capable models, with the gains accomplished in one model version sometimes lost in the following version.",

      "Nonstationarity in Southern Hemisphere Climate Variability Associated with the Seasonal Breakdown of the Stratospheric Polar Vortex",
      "In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), the main source of stratospheric polar vortex variability is stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs), which typically precede an equatorward shift of the eddy-driven jets (EDJ) and therefore have a signal in the tropospheric annular modes (e.g., Baldwin & Dunkerton, 2001; Hitchcock & Simpson, 2014; Karpechko et al., 2017).\nIn the Southern Hemisphere (SH), the stratospheric polar vortex variability is mainly associated with interannual variability in the seasonal cycle leading up to the springtime polar vortex breakdown: Anomalously strong polar vortex years, which tend to have an anomalously late vortex breakdown, are associated with a stronger poleward shift of the EDJ in September\u2013November and a delay in the equatorward EDJ shift in early summer (Byrne et al., 2017; Byrne & Shepherd, 2018; Hio & Yoden, 2005; Seviour et al., 2014).\nThus, for skillful tropospheric predictability in these periods it is pertinent that numerical weather and climate prediction models are able to faithfully represent stratospheric dynamics and stratosphere-troposphere dynamical coupling in both hemispheres.",
      "The strength of the SPV during this lead-up period has a strong influence on the timing of the breakdown event, as well as on the latitude of the EDJ in the troposphere (Byrne & Shepherd, 2018).\nIn addition, the SPV breakdown event itself typically precedes an equatorward shift of the EDJ (Byrne et al., 2017).\nThis close relationship between the SPV and the EDJ in the SH can be parsimoniously viewed as a continuous shift of the seasonal cycle during this time of year (Byrne & Shepherd, 2018).",
      "Figure 6 focuses on the equatorward transition of the EDJ in early summer using hindcasts initialized on 1 November, so that the hindcasts are as close to observations as possible during the vortex breakdown period.\nThe timing of the equatorward transition of the EDJ has been found to be closely coupled to the SPV breakdown date in the reanalysis (Byrne et al., 2017).\nIn particular, years with a later than average SPV BYRNE ET AL.",
      "In fact, ozone depletion is suggested to be responsible for the dominant part of the poleward shift of the tropospheric jet stream in the Southern Hemisphere [Polvani et al., 2011; Gerber et al., 2012].\nDownward coupling can also be found through interannual variability [Kuroda and Kodera, 1998] and through the impact of the final warming [Black and McDaniel , 2007; Sun et al., 2014; Byrne et al., 2017].\nIn the tropics, the QBO has recently been found to have a possible downward influence on the tropical troposphere, in particular on the MJO [Yoo and Son, 2016; Marshall et al., 2016; Son et al., 2017; Geller et al., 2017].",
      "Instead, most studies have interpreted the enhanced SAM autocorrelation timescale in terms of purely tropospheric eddy-feedback processes (Lorenz & Hartmann, 2001; Simpson et al., 2013).\nObservational studies have shown that the vortex BD plays an organizing role for tropospheric circulation anomalies on weekly to monthly timescales (Black & McDaniel, 2007; Byrne et al., 2017; Hio & Yoden, 2005).\nEstimates of such potential for predictability, in terms of strength and timescale of the signal, have been quantified with lagged correlations (Byrne & Shepherd, 2018; Gerber et al., 2010; Graversen & Christiansen, 2003) or regression patterns (Thompson et al., 2005).",

      "The main disadvantage of using reanalysis data is different validation in different regions of the world [8, 9].\nFrom the existing reanalysis databases were selected covering all territory of Russia (CFSR [10], MERRA [11], NCEP/NCAR [12]) and data of the secondary reanalysis (Met Office [13]) and Vortex [14]), which scales traditional reanalysis data with using NWP models with higher resolution.\nAlgorithm is conducted in several stages:",

      "\nIt is also established that the concurrent positive trend in the SAM seen in austral summer is a response to the same cause, with a poleward trend of the tropospheric jet (McLandress et al.\u00a0, 2011) corresponding to a delayed seasonal equatorward shift (Byrne et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2014).\nWe force Equation (1) with the reanalysis vortex trend, determine the predicted synthetic jet trend, and compare it with the reanalysis jet trend.",
      "\nHowever, a trend towards a later break-up of the polar vortex due to the stratospheric cooling trend has been observed [Waugh et al.\u00a0, 1999], with potentially important implications for the SH troposphere [Sheshadri et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014; Byrne et al., 2017].\n"

      "However, it is also known that not all users benefit from their antidepressant medication [4\u20136].\nThe ultimate reason behind therapeutic failure is unknown, but in addition to treatment compliance, insufficient response to treatment due to ultra-rapid citalopram metabolism as well as poor metabolism related adverse effects have been proposed [6, 7].\nMany psychoactive drugs, including SSRIs, are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are known to harbor inter-individual variation [8].",
      "However, based on the calculated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), the observed differences in point-estimates were not statistically significant.\nAs both extreme CYP2C19 gMPs, gPM and gUM, may lead to therapeutic failure [6], we combined these extreme phenotype groups and compared the combined frequency to the similarly combined frequencies from controls.\nWe observed that this extreme gMP group was significantly more frequent among suicide cases compared to controls 0.356 [0.31\u20130.41] vs.\u00a00.265 [0.24\u20130.30] (p = 0.0065) (Fig.",
      "In this study, we observed that the combined group of extreme gMPs (gPM and gUM) of CYP2C19 was significantly more common among citalopram-treated suicide victims compared to Finnish population controls, 0.356 [0.31\u20130.41] vs.\u00a00.265 [0.24\u20130.30] (p = 0.0065).\nThis finding is in line with our hypothesis as well as with clinical studies investigating genetic variation inCYP2C19 and citalopram treatment failure [6, 30].\nIn clinical studies, CYP2C19 variation has been shown to alter individuals\u2019 exposure to citalopram and escitalopram [31, 32].",
      "Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence on both the dose-dependent effect of antidepressants and between serum levels and clinical improvement/adverse effects, including no increased effect when the recommended reference ranges are exceeded [27, 33\u201338].\nA recent work from our laboratory demonstrated a u-shaped risk of switching from escitalopram to alternative antidepressant therapy that correlated with both high and low serum concentrations of escitalopram, which likely reflects unacceptable adverse effects or lack of effect, respectively [38].\nWhen using TDM data, there are some limitations that should be taken into consideration.",
      "It is however likely that future well designed and sufficiently powered studies in other therapeutic areas might increase the importance of pharmacogenomic predictions also in other therapeutic areas, such as psychiatry, asthma and infectious diseases.\nOne such example is the recent finding that CYP2C19 genotype determines a large fraction of the inter-individual variability of pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the antidepressant escitalopram in>2000 patients (Juki\u0107 et al., 2018).\nThe results showed https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2019.01.024 Received 6 September 2018; Received in revised form 21 January 2019; Accepted 22 January 2019 \u204e Corresponding author at: Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Section of Pharmacogenetics, Biomedicum 5B, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.",
      "Antidepressant medications remain a key mode of treatment for moderate to severe MDD.\nHowever, their efficacy is variable and incomplete because 60\u201370% of depressed patients do not experience remission, and 30\u201340% of depressed patients do not show a significant response or experience drug side effects that result in treatment discontinuation, non-adherence, and chronic illness [2, 3].\nIndividual variability in the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes is a major source of the differences to drug exposure and, hence, a contributor to variations in drug responses [4].",
      "No patient presented clinical symptoms of infection.\nGenotype frequencies of the cytochrome P450 2C19 gene (CYP2C19) polymorphisms *2, *3 and *17 were similar to those reported previously (Juki\u0107 et al., 2018; Rosemary and Adithan, 2007; Scott et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2017).\nThe mean BMI of the patients was on the border line of overweight.",
      "Neither of the meta-analyses addressed the relevance of the individual variability in sertraline serum concentration or CYP2C19 genotypes, but the results clearly indicate that rapid sertraline metabolism, which is observed here in NMs and UMs, may cause therapeutic failure due to insufficient exposure.\nIn a previous study on escitalopram, CYP2C19 *1/*17 and *17/ *17 carriers obtained a 10% and 20% lower serum concentration compared to CYP2C19 NMs, respectively [20].\nFor sertraline in the current study, patients carrying the CYP2C19*17 allele only had an 8% lower serum concentration compared to NMs.",
      "Furthermore, guidelines issued by pharmacogenetics expert workgroups (CPIC and DPWG) provide recommendations to optimize genotype-guided prescription for 14 drugs [32].\nFor instance, CYP2C19 genotype affects treatment efficacy and risk of adverse events when treated with the antidepressant escitalopram [33], and for ultrarapid CYP2C19 metabolizers it is recommended to select an alternative drug not predominantly metabolized by CYP2C19.\nAs the cost effectiveness of pharmacogenetic implementation is dependent on carrier frequencies, falsely high population frequencies might erroneously incentivize pre-emptive CYP2C19 genotyping.",
      "For example, the analysis of escitalopram serum concentration measurements from 2,087 CYP2C19genotyped patients 10-30 hours after drug intake collected retrospectively from the drug monitoring database indicated that compared with the EM (CYP2C19*1/*1) group, escitalopram serum concentrations were 3.\n3 times higher in subjects carrying two inactive variant alleles [112].\nFollowing a single oral 40 mg dose of citalopram to 77 healthy Chinese volunteers citalopram AUC and terminal elimination half-life in PMs were significantly higher than the values in EMs who were either homozygous or heterozygous with CYP2C19*1."

      "Development and validation of a comprehensive genomic diagnostic tool for myeloid malignancies",
      "Numerous examples of customdeveloped methods targeting specific genes related to myeloid neoplasia are described in the literature.\nMost methods describe the ability to detect mutations that are commonly encountered in myeloid neoplasia [142, 143], with hybridizationcapture enrichment techniques often noting the ability to detect large structural rearrangements and translocations [144].\nAlthough amplicon-based NGS panels typically are not designed to detect larger indels or CNVs, several bioinformatics E.Q.",
      "The 2008 WHO classification of neoplastic diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues [9] and its recent revision [13] clearly reflect this tendency by increasingly recognizing cytogenetic/molecular categories in the new nomenclature of the acute leukemias, thereby reducing those disease entities which rely on morphology and/or immunophenotype alone and invariably suffer from reduced prognostic significance.\nComprehensive genomic profiling can now be performed in the clinical setting to improve the diagnosis of hematologic malignancies [38, 39] and more precisely match patients with targeted therapies [40].\nThe emphasis on marker compositions and single antigens which are associated with genetic features and/or carry prognostic significance irrespective of lineage affiliation should be viewed as a new role for immunophenotyping that deviates from mere lineage identification.",
      "43 Also, with the nature of heterogeneity seen in MDS, some scoring 44 systems were introduced to evaluate the prognosis of patients with 45 MDS, such as IPSS-R[11], all having parameters like peripheral 46 cytopenias, bone marrow blasts percentage and cytogenetic 47 characteristics.\nYet, molecular patterns were not included in the 48 prognostic scoring systems, though, as many genetic biomarkers were 49 found significant in predicting the outcome of this disease [10, 12, 13].\n50 Some scholars believe that MDS is the prelude of AML, or, both 51 MDS and AML are at the end stage of a stepwise process of 52 malignant clonal evolution in hematopoiesis.",
      "Only one of the three chronic myeloid leukemia samples had a mutation in the SETBP1 gene.\nPatient AML1, carrier of a translocation t(8;21)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1, showed a KIT mutation (p.\nAsp816His) not previously identified by conventional Sanger sequencing.",
      "Two of these fusions, an inv(16) and a t(9; 22)/minor BCR-ABL1, had been detected by karyotyping and/or FISH as well as RQ-PCR (AML04 and AML08) (Table 1).\nOther three fusions, two t(8;21) and one inv(16) (AML02, 03, 05) were identified only by RQ-PCR, and one t(11;19) only by cytogenetics (AML13).\nFinally, the MLL-PTD (n=2) cases were identified by both RQ-PCR and Enrichment software.",
      "In addition, lesions were identified in other genes with prognostic value such as DNMT3A, SRSF2, and IDH2 that have already been proposed to be included in future prognostic guidelines 21.\nEven more, a patient with the good prognostic translocation t(8;21)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (patient AML1) was found to have a poor prognostic KIT mutation not identified by Sanger sequencing.\nFurthermore, missense mutations could be detected at position 835 of FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) in two patients.",
      "Both cases had a normal karyotype, and one of them was seen by FISH (75% cells with 11q23/MLL positive).\nIn all cases with frequent AML translocations, t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16), and t(9;11), for which both partners were included in the NGS design, the rearrangement was captured and sequenced from both sides.\nIn cases that were captured only by one of the two partners, the strategy also worked as expected, as in the case with the t(6;11), captured from the KMT2A side.",
      "Therefore, the future versions could include only one of the two genes involved in each translocation, which would reduce the costs and complexity of the analysis.\nUsing the Enrichment software there were six (25%) false negative cases, including relevant rearrangements such as two inv(16), two t(8;21), one t(9;22)/ BCR-ABL1-minor, and one t(11;19).\n14 Therefore, the bioinformatic pipeline was implemented to dilucidate if the panel design or the analysis was the problem.",
      "FLT3-ITDs are traditionally detected and quantified by PCR amplification of genomic DNA using primers flanking FLT3 exons 14\u201315 followed by fragment (sizing) analysis via capillary electrophoresis (CE) [12, 13].\nGiven the increasing adoption of targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) into routine clinical practice, molecular laboratories have also started to integrate FLT3-ITD assessment into comprehensive hematologic DNA-based NGS panels [14, 15, 16].\nStandard NGS pipelines typically detect ITDs only when captured as insertions during alignment, thus missing longer ITDs while systematically underestimating allelic ratios of shorter ITDs due to recognition of only a partial subset of mutant reads.",

      "Outside Africa, Zika\u2019s first cases were reported in Java Island, Indonesia, in 1977 [4].\nThere are recent retrospective seroprevalence studies, confirmed by more sophisticated molecular techniques, indicating that Zika virus was already circulating on the African and Asian continents since the 1950s, though without causing any outbreak [5].\nThe first outbreak of Zika in humans occurred in Yap Island, Micronesia, in 2007.",
      "The estimates of 5000 cases in this island over a 3-year period are derived from seroprevalence surveys using low or moderate specificity serological tests (anti-IgG), which were (and they still are) the only ones available on a large scale for the serological diagnosis of Zika, at the time of the Yap outbreak.\nThe French Polynesian epidemic began in October 2013 with the reporting, including molecular proof, of three cases in the same household [5].\nAfter these first patients, it is estimated that more than 19,000 may have been reported; as the total population of French Polynesia is approximately 270,000 people, it is possible that the infection has reached 100,000 people, almost half of the population [5].",

      "Best estimates of the ZIKV incubation period before symptoms are 3.\n5 to 10 days, then symptoms may last a few days to a week [3].\nIn an effort to standardize the classification and reporting of ZIKV cases, the WHO published case definitions for ZIKV disease: clinical criteria are met if fever or rash is present in addition to either arthralgia, arthritis, or conjunctivitis [7].",
      "Later in 2007, ZIKV emerged in the Pacific island of Yap, in 2013 in French Polynesia and other Pacific islands and from there expanding to mainland Latin America in 2015 causing the biggest outbreak to date [10\u201312].\nThe limited serologic surveys that are available found a high-level population exposure reaching from 42% in French Polynesia and 49% in Martinique, to as much as 63% in mainland America, specifically Brazil [5, 13, 14].\nIf ZIKV confers long-lasting immunity, high exposure could create sufficient herd immunity limiting local resurgence and upcoming epidemics [5].",
      "ZIKV have caused an unprecedented ongoing epidemic in Pacific and Latin America with more than 1 million cases suspected (Sharma and Lal 2017).\nIn humans, ZIKV infection is characterized by an acute, mild, febrile illness with a majority of asymptomatic infections; however, it has been linked to a rising number of severe neurological diseases, including microcephaly and GBS (Gallian et al.\u00a02017; Sharma and Lal 2017).\nNeurological complications after ZIKV infection have been described first in French Polynesia, with an estimated risk of GBS at 0.24 per 1000 Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1007/s13365-018-0621-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",

      "Undeniable linkage of temporality, fetal brain isolates, analogous biological reinforcement in animal and human organoid models, and the coincidence of related malformations currently leave little doubt that ZIKV may damage a susceptible fetus [17,18].\nThese more serious outcomes prompted investigations uncovering evidence of transmission by transfusion [11] and sex [10,12,19], and on 1 February 2016 the WHO declared the situation a matter of international public health concern [16].\nAs with many other arboviral diseases, the ZIKV epidemic is further compounded by disproportionate vector risk near lowresource populations least equipped to fully detect and handle outbreaks.",
      "After a short incubation (1e5 days via mosquito,z7 via sex) viraemia crests for 1 day, diminishes drastically within 1e3 days, and tends to persist no longer than 10 days [9,18,27,28,37,38,41].\nViraemia kinetics seem unrelated to sex or symptomology [11,28,38], with the exception of pregnant women, who may shed virus into plasma for up to 14 weeks [41].\nThough this is likely to be a result of spillover from fetal compartment central nervous system tissue (and highly related to microcephaly pathogenesis) [18] and does not always occur, it can allow for a prolonged window of detection in this highest risk groups.",
      "The incubation period is typically between 3-10 days after infection [2].\nAn estimated 20% of cases are symptomatic, however, this is being challenged by emerging data that show much higher proportion of infected individuals become symptomatic after infection [3, 4].\nThe most common route of transmission is via bites of Ades aegypti mosquitos, , and less commonly through sexual exposure and blood transfusion [2, 5]."

      "Recent work by IngelmanSundberg, Mkrtchian, Zhou, and Lauschke (2018) highlighted the prevalence of low-frequency variants in 208 pharmacogenes.\nThis work showed that rare pharmacogenetic variants can strongly affect functional changes in the protein (Ingelman-Sundberg et al., 2018).\nFurthermore, the presence of rare deleterious variants was highly gene and drug specific.",
      "The vast majority of variants in CYP genes were rare and population-scale regression models indicate that only a small fraction of the overall genetic variability has been identified to date (Fujikura et al., 2015; Gordon et al., 2014).\nSimilarly, > 90% of variants identified in other ADME genes, such as SLCO transporters, UGTs, GSTs or SULTs were rare and mostly population-specific (Ahn and Park, 2017; Bush et al., 2016; Ingelman-Sundberg et al., 2018; Kozyra et al., 2017; Wright et al., 2016; Zhang and Lauschke, 2018).\nParticularly in isolated populations with narrow recent bottlenecks, such as Ashkenazi Jews, population-specific pharmacogenetic variants constitute important factors for drug response predictions (Zhou and Lauschke, 2018).",
      "Importantly, every individual was found to harbor on average 4.\n4 rare variants with putative deleterious effects, emphasizing their potential clinical importance (Ingelman-Sundberg et al., 2018).\nSeminal work by Ramsey and colleagues provided the first quantitative estimates of the importance of rare genetic variants on drug response using methotrexate disposition as clinical paradigm (Ramsey et al., 2012).",
      "While the genetically encoded functional variability in some genes, including CYP2C19, CYP2D6, SLC22A1 and TPMT, was mostly allotted to common variants, rare genetic variants were important factors for multiple genes with demonstrated pharmacogenetic associations, including CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 for which rare variants were estimated to explain 18.4% and 43.1% of the functional variability, respectively (Ingelman-Sundberg et al., 2018).\nFurthermore, rare variants were the most important genetic determinant in> 50% of the analyzed 208 pharmacogenes, including those genes for which no common variant with functional effects has been presented (Ingelman-Sundberg et al., 2018).\nThese findings underline the potential impact of rare genetic variants on drug response phenotypes and incentivize a paradigm shift away from genotyping of few well-characterized, common candidate polymorphisms towards comprehensive NGS-based approaches.",
      "Therefore, the reported figures are to be interpreted in consideration of several factors.\nIn larger sample sizes common variants are shared between individuals as rare variation adds to the non-overlapping part [43].\nHigh population stratification increases observed population-specific variants and comparability is also hampered by variable selection of pharmacogenetics variants.",
      "Note that while exons were targeted for panel design, optimization of amplicon size involved capturing some intronic loci.\nWhile not specifically interrogated here, there are common and intronic, promoter, enhancer, and/or silencer SNVs that have been implicated in variable gene expression, splicing, and/or post-translational modifications that need to be explored further to develop fully pathwaydriven models of drug-specific and drug-class ADME-R [35].\nUtilizing comprehensive MPS (referred to as nextgeneration sequencing by Ingelman-Sundberg et al.",
      "Regarding the non-polymorphic variants, we observed that all of them are low-frequency variants (lower than 0.00065) and we do not expect to find a heterozygous individual due to the sample size in our repository (Supplementary Table S1).\nApart from the genetic variants already recommended to be implemented in the clinical setting, it was found that genetic variability with functional impact was governed by few high-frequency variants for some genes, but the functionality of the majority of pharmacogenes is dominated by rare genetic variants (57).\nIn addition, local variability in these ADMET genes could also be very relevant for explaining a substantial part of the unexplained interindividual differences in drug response and toxicities at the population-specific level, so that it is mandatory to have available population-specific catalogs of these pharmavariants (mainly rare) to explore their contribution to predictions of drug response.",
      "The development of NGS has enabled researchers to obtain information on both common and rare genetic variants, overcoming many intrinsic biases of an SNP typing approach.\nWith a slight delay, this change has also involved pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics [10,76] (electronic supplementary material, table S2).\nIn the following, I first discuss important aspects of rare genetic variants that can assist in interpreting their patterns in human PGx loci; then I provide examples of studies focusing on rare variants in genes for drug targets, DMEs and transporters.",
      "Moreover, individuals of European and African ancestry harbour, on average, 101 and 121 SNVs within these 146 pharmacogenes, respectively [124].\nImportantly, the contribution of rare and common variation to the putative function of individual pharmacogenes varies substantially between genes and overall, up to 30-40% of geneticmediated functional variation in pharmacogenes might be attributable to rare variants [124, 125].\nIn oncology, germline rare variants in SLCO1B1 identified by deep resequencing have been associated with methotrexate clearance in paediatric ALL, in addition to common SLCO1B1 variation [95].",
      "Current & future use of CYP1A2 genotyping in CLO patients Clinicians need to know that after considering sex, smoking status and ethnicity to label a patient a CLO PM: phenoconversion by inhibitors, inflammation or obesity needs to be ruled out and current commercial CYP1A2 genotyping offers no help.\nOn the other hand, researchers need to sequence the DNA of these patients to identify the unknown and probably rare mutations at the CYP1A2 gene [30] that may explain CLO PMs in non-Asian and Asian patients.\nThe DNA sequencing of nuclear receptor genes may be a more reasonable target in CLO UMs."

      "In general, higher blood NFL levels were observed in more advanced PD and, in the Lund PD cohort, a higher blood NFL concentration was associated with disease duration and more severe motor symptoms (measured as Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage, Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III motor score, Timed Up and Go Test, and Tandem Gait Test).\nConversely, no clinical correlations were described in the London cohort and the early-stage disease cohort [156].\nHowever, further studies confirmed the positive relation between plasma NFL levels and motor symptom severity (measured as H&Y stage and UPDRS part III score) and proved a significant correlation between plasmaNFL concentration and cognitive dysfunction at MMSE [161, 162].",
      "Such heterogeneity may reflect differences in study design, since PSP patients have been evaluated as a separate group in some studies but not in others where PSP, MSA, and CBD patients have been combined as a whole group.\nSpecifically, blood NFL levels positively correlated with motor symptom severity, evaluated as H&Y stage and with UPDRS III motor score, but not with disease duration or other clinical assessments, in the AP group (including also MSA and CBD patients) [156].\nSimilarly, serum NFL concentration at baseline correlated with motor performances, measured with the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale score and Tandem Gait Test in another cohort of AP patients including PSP [158].",
      "We could not determine whether the changes in serum levels reflect CSF.\nInterestingly, a strong association between CSF NfL and sNfL had been reported (Disanto et al.\u00a02017; Hansson et al.\u00a02017; Hendricks et al.\u00a02019).\nSecond, the sNfL was tested one time at admission."

      "Genetic testing in ALS",
      "However, a recent international online survey including 21 different worldwide countries confirmed that there is still a lack of consensus among clinicians regarding the definition of FALS.\nThis survey showed that genetic testing is not always an evidence-based process and is further complicated by significant differences in practice across geographic regions [29].\nFinally, it is crucial but not always simple to distinguish between disease-causing genes and genes associated with ALS, as more evidence is needed for causality.",
      "Furthermore, identifying a specific genetic cause of dementia can be difficult due to phenotypic overlap between the different forms of dementia subtypes, locus heterogeneity, and variability in accessibility of genetic tests (Beck et al., 2014).\nIn clinical settings, genetic testing is recommended for patients who have a first-degree-affected relative or in sporadic occurrences with an unusually early age of onset (Sorbi et al., 2012; Vajda et al., 2017).\nThe usual clinical approach is to test a single gene or a limited group of genes using Sanger sequencing, according to specific flow-charts (Cohn-Hokke et al., 2012; Bocchetta et al., 2016).",
      "Although the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide is the most common amyloid protein implicated in sporadic and hereditary forms of CAA, other genes involved in rare familial CAA include integral membrane protein 2B (BRI2 or ITM2B), transthyretin (TTR), and gelsolin (GSN) (Revesz et al., 2009).\nFor a time and cost-effective issue, targeted massive parallel sequencing (which has a higher depth of coverage than wide exome screening, allowing for more accurate and efficient variants calling) of a clinically significant gene panel has been shown to be a potent method for evaluating diseases with high genetic heterogeneity or with several differential diagnoses (Wang et al., 2017; Nicolas et al., 2016; Vajda et al., 2017; Nishiyama et al., 2017).\nRecently, a similar approach has been successfully applied to patients with early-onset dementia (Beck et al., 2014).",
      "In particular, PRKAR1B has been recently linked to neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (Wong et al., 2015), and we reported, for the first time, in our population, two other patients with ALS or FTD, carrying variants in this gene (Table 3).\nA recent survey demonstrated that the average number of ALS genes routinely tested in Europe and North America is four, and the rates of testing do not always reflect the prevalence of diseasecausing variants (Gibson et al., 2017; Vajda et al., 2017).\nUsing our approach, we found that in our population, variants in the \u201crare\u201d genes accounted for 9.64% of FTD/ALS patients, which would have failed to be detected with traditional genetic diagnostic protocols.",
      "At this time, there is no consistent approach to the offer of genetic testing to patients with sALS, which represent the majority of ALS patients.\nAs other authors have pointed out, difficulties in obtaining family history information, in addition to inconsistent definitions of fALS, further complicate the situation (2,4,13).\nThe universal offer of the C9orf72HRE to all patients with ALS would obviate some of these difficulties (12).",
      "Genetic testing of the five most prevalent genes found to be mutated in ALS is routinely offered to patients with a positive family history (C9orf72, SOD1, TDP-43, FUS, TBK-1).\nAlthough there is no consensus on genetic testing for patients with sporadic ALS, there is a trend to offer it to all patients [76, 77].\nHowever, genetic testing should only be performed if genetic counseling can be provided in the event a pathogenic gene mutation is identified.",
      "Some patients also reported with extrapyramidal, ataxia, or psychosis.\nNeuropathological examination of central nervous system (CNS) tissues from patients with TBK1 mutations revealed that SQSTM1/p62- and TDP-43-positive inclusion bodies which can indicate abnormalities in TDP-43 protein aggregation and protein clearance pathways [1, 2, 4, 5].\n2.7 TARDBP The TARDBP (trans-activation element DNA-binding protein), located in 1p36.22, was discovered in 2008 [5].",
      "\nEvidence suggests that there is a growing consensus to offer genetic testing to patients with familial disease, but there is no consistent approach to the offer of testing to the typical patient, who has apparently sporadic disease (79,80).\nA recent survey of ALS clinicians revealed that 74%would be more likely to offer ALS genetic testing if testing guidelines were in place.",
      "\nGenetic information was not always perceived as particularly useful in the clinical setting (36,39,45,58,59,61,62,65).\nGenetic information was described as irrelevant by nurses and physicians in certain clinical disciplines, such as ophthalmology,(36) and by particular professionals, such as breast surgeons.",
      "\nMost recently, Vajda et al.\u00a0(4) surveyed an international group of neurologists and found that 90.2% offered genetic testing to fALS patients and 49.4% offered to sALS patients.\n"

      "Given the significant lack of data on survival regarding edaravone (situation #2), further studies are necessary to fully characterize this therapeutic to which the survival predictors we have described above can be applied.\nHowever, edaravone is projected to only benefit 6% of the European ALS community, which is a main reason for its non-approval in most European countries [1,74].\nThis is because no trials have yet been conducted in the Western world, as edaravone has only been clinically tested in a specific range of Japanese ALS subgroups.",
      "Additionally, the inhibitor improved induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-MN survival from a SOD1-ALS patient carrying a L114FVX mutation, and also delayed onset and improved survival in the G93A-SOD1 mouse.\nTDP-43 protein misfolding is a major pathological hallmark of ALS and aggregates are present in approximately 97% of all ALS cases [6,31,32].\nTDP-43 is known to self-interact; so, an in vitro assay was designed to test 1280 compounds for the ability to inhibit self-interaction and prevent aggregation [33].",
      "While there is not yet such a treatment, significant survival improvement might be expected in coming decades.\nFor example, randomized controlled trial evidence shows that Riluzole can improve 12-month survival by about 35% (7), and lithium may improve the survival of a genetic subgroup (8).\nEdaravone, though not licensed in the UK, has been shown to slow functional decline in ALS for a subgroup of patients (9).",
      "Compared to sporadic ALS, familial ALS is associated with a younger age at onset of the disease, and monogenic ALS is associated with a younger age of onset than polygenic ALS (21).\nCorrelations between genetic variants and different clinical profiles in ALS, such as age at onset, disease duration, and site of onset, have been reported (22).\nHowever, carrying a disease mutation does not inevitably lead to ALS due to incomplete penetrance of some genes and modifying factors, presumably including gene-gene interactions and environmental modulation mediated through epigenetic effects (23).",
      "Besides mood disorders, increased levels and activity of PKC are detected in the cervical spinal cord of ALS patients compared with controls (Lanius et al., 1995; Wagey et al., 1998).\nIncreased PKC activity may affect neuronal viability and foster disease progression (Krieger et al., 1996).\nThis is shown in ALS mice, where increased expression of PKC occurs, leading to downregulation of the chloride channel 1 (ClC-1) (Camerino et al., 2019).",
      "Motor neuron (MN) diseases are a group of neurodegenerative diseases where MNs selectively degenerate.\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, known as motor neuron disease in United Kingdom and Australia, and Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease in the USA) is the most common form [1,2], with approximately 1\u20132 newly diagnosed cases in every 100,000 people internationally every year [3].\nIn ALS, both the upper MNs in the motor cortex and the associated corticospinal tract, and the lower MNs in the brainstem and spinal cord selectively degenerate.",
      "Likewise, in mice carrying a spontaneous mutation in the E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC1, a reduction of the motor end-plate area is detected along with inefficient neuromuscular activity and impaired evoked neurotransmitter release at the NMJ [155].\nSimilarly to autophagy, the UPS at the Drosophila NMJ controls synaptic vesicle priming and neurotransmitter release probability through the turnover of UNC-13 presynaptic protein [156], which is altered in neurological disorders including ALS [131,137].\nTherefore, autophagy and UPS-dependent targeting of synaptic proteins is key to orchestrating neurotransmitter release and the size of synaptic vesicles pools at the NMJ."

      "All of the included studies were published in 2013 or later.\nFour articles included data from the same sample (20,21,23,27); one article included data from this same sample with additional participants (22).\nThe overall sample sizes of the selected studies ranged from 11 to 288 participants and the sample sizes for relevant analyses ranged from 6 to 87 participants.",
      "However, when the same sample was divided into return to play greater than and less than 6 days, there were no significant differences in S100B levels at 1-h post-injury (27).\nFurther, when the data were re-analyzed with additional participants in the sample, there was no significant correlation between S100B at 1-h post-injury and post-concussion symptom report (22).\nCorrelation analyses conducted using raw data published by Schulte and colleagues in their study of the clinical utility of biomarkers, yielded non-significant correlations between postinjury levels of S100B and measures of balance and postconcussion symptoms (24).",
      "However, three of the four studies utilized the same sample of professional ice hockey players and presented new analyses of the same data set (20,23,27), thereby limiting the generalizability of this finding.\nOne additional study re-analyzed this dataset with additional participants and results demonstrated a significant relationship between tau levels at 1-h post-injury and post-concussion symptom report (22).\nIn a separate sample, Gill and colleagues found that although higher levels of tau were related to prolonged return to play within athletes with concussions, tau levels in athletes with concussions were significantly lower than athletes without concussions at 24 h and 72 h post-injury (25).",
      "Of note, there were several highly significant relationship correlations between MiRNAs and impacts to the head (17).\nNeurofilament light (NFL) has been evaluated in both blood and CSF (22,26).\nIn a study evaluating NFL in CSF, boxers with persistently high NFL (at least 14 days post-bout) performed significantly worse on measures of processing speed and reaction time (26).",
      "In a study evaluating NFL in CSF, boxers with persistently high NFL (at least 14 days post-bout) performed significantly worse on measures of processing speed and reaction time (26).\nShahim and colleagues reported a significant correlation between post-concussion NFL levels measured in blood and post-concussion symptom endorsement (22).\nAdditionally, NFL levels did not change following a friendly game without concussion, suggesting that it is not sensitive to exertion alone (22).",
      "Neurofilament light (NfL) is a type of intermediate filament seen in the cytoplasm of axons, where it plays an important role in axonal homeostasis and synaptic transmission [35].\nNfL concentrations dynamically increase in response to concussion, as demonstrated in amateur boxers and ice hockey players [36, 37].\nNfL has also been used as a biomarker of disease intensity, since it correlates with neuroaxonal damage in a wide range of neurological disorders [38].",
      "UCHL1 is well-known to be elevated within 24 h after severe, not subconcussive, TBI (41\u201343).\nNf-L and tau are typically elevated during much later timeframes and associated with CT abnormalities (25, 44, 45).\nSerum taumay also be elevated acutely after exposure to moderate psi levels in rodent models (46).",
      "relevance of serum GFAP (D1 and D3) and Nf-L (D3 only) suppression as well as the correlation between decreased GFAP and peak OP levels is not yet known and potentially confounding, when viewed in the context of longer timeframes or clinically diagnosed, moderate-to-severe TBI as a predetermined endpoint.\nHowever, it is interesting to note that Nf-L levels decreased 1\u201312 h within serum collected from hockey players post\u2013game play (25).\nThis time-dependent observation is often overlooked and may indicate that acute (e.g., hourly) temporal dynamics of Nf-L may be useful in monitoring early phase OP-mediated effects when compared to a participant\u2019s basal biomarker levels, whereas leakage of a fairly large protein from the CNS is useful in the context of a known variable (e.g., clinical TBI diagnosis) during longer timeframes (e.g., weeks\u2013months).",
      "EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES IN TBI Biomarker studies in TBI have focused on plasma and serum levels of proteins found in brain cells such as tau, p-tau, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) (152, 153); glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), that is released from astrocytes (13); and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCHL1), a brain-specific deubiquitinating enzyme (154).\nNfL, GFAP, tau and UCHL1 have been linked to TBI severity, poor recovery, as well as PCS and PTSD symptomology in a variety of populations, including civilians (23, 155, 156), athletes (157, 158) and military personnel (11, 90, 159).\nOther studies have evaluated levels of inflammatory markers (134\u2013137) as previously discussed in this article."

      "For example, depression often precedes diagnosis in AD [19,20], PD [21] and ALS [22] by one or more years.\nExecutive dysfunction is found in people with AD [23], PD [24] and ALS [25].\nThe development of depression, anxiety and apathy has been observed in people with AD, PD and ALS [26\u201329], as has the loss of olfaction [30\u201332] and gait changes [33,34].",
      "Some ALS patients may also show cognitive impairment in various domains such as executive function, language, and fluency (Phukan et al., 2007; Raaphorst et al., 2010; Goldstein and Abrahams, 2013; Beeldman et al., 2016).\nMild cognitive deficits are more frequently observed in the advanced stage of ALS than in the early stage (Crockford et al., 2018).\nHowever, there is also a report with LIS patients suffering from ALS who showed no signs of cognitive decline during testing using an eye-tracking system (Linse et al., 2017).",
      "A negative impact of behavioural changes such as apathy, disinhibition and abnormal behaviour on caregivers\u2019 wellbeing, was also recognized in previous studies in ALS caregivers (Lillo, Mioshi, & Hodges, 2012; Watermeyer et al., 2015).\nThe presence of behavioural changes is common in patients with ALS and PMA and becomes more frequent in more severe disease stages (Crockford et al., 2018; de Vries et al., 2019).\nHowever, patients and caregivers are not always informed that cognitive or behavioural changes can arise in these diseases (Wicks & Frost, 2008).",
      "As seen within the ENCALS model, measuring cognitive and behavioral decline shouldnot beoverlookedwhen testing survival.\nApproximately 35% of patients exhibit mild impairments, while 15% develop severe frontotemporal dementia [70].\nMoreover, multiple studies suggest that cognitive and behavioral abnormalities negatively influence survival [71,72].",
      "Local and collaborative teams can also apply for access to anonymized data from consenting patients for research.\nScottish research projects have included the study of the epidemiology of MND in Scotland, genotype-phenotype correlations [3], cognitive profiles [26,27,35], neuropsychiatric phenotypes, and clinico-pathological studies [36].\nCARE-MND has also provided data for collaborative work with international partners, including oropharyngeal secretion management [37] and genetics [38,39].",
      "Increased appetite and disruptions in eating behaviors have been documented in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (41), and across the ALS-FTD spectrum (29).\nUp to 80% of patients with ALS experience some form of behavioral change as disease progresses and changes in behaviors towards food become more prevalent over time (42).\nOur observations suggest that behaviors around eating and food preference in ALS may not always favor positive energy balance.",
      "(39).\nIt can be postulated that the behavioral changes seem to become prevalent in ALS as the neurodegeneration progresses and the functionality rate deteriorates (12,39).\nNotably, in this sample, neither the depression index nor the ECAS-behavioral score was related to any cognitive measure.",
      "All ALS-specific cognitive screeners are well-adaptable to motor problems, unlike the non-ALS-specific screeners.\nFurthermore, cognitive deficits and behavioral impairments are more frequent in ALSpatients who are in a more severe disease stage (85,86).\nAccording to King\u2019s stages (87), patients within the most severe disease stage (stage 4) experience respiratory or nutritional insufficiency requiring intervention.",
      "Ideally, the effects of these insufficiencies on cognitive performance and/or behavioral changes should be taken into account while screening in ALS patients.\nIn particular, in patients with respiratory insufficient hypercapnia (stage 4), only a small group is free of cognitive and behavioral impairments (85).\nHowever, possible overestimation of the cognitive and behavioral impairments between disease stages should be taken into account due to bulbar symptoms."

      "In fact, these may ultimately be preferable to T-tau as a CSF-based (N) biomarker.\nBecause CSF P-tau and T-tau are highly correlated in AD and are equally correlated with tau PET [124], they do not seem to provide independent information in AD.\nConceptually, it might be useful to think of ATX(N), where X is an array of biomarkers of specific pathologic processes, which hopefully will become available in the future (TDP43, synuclein, etc.",

      "We assumed that the A\u03b2-positive MCI patients had prodromal AD, but we acknowledge the possibility that some MCI patients may have other underlying pathologies which contributed to their cognitive decline.\nHowever, CSF Ttau and P-tau, which are strongly associated with MCI due to AD, and which are associated with cortical tau accumulation (Mattsson et al., 2017), were actually further increased in the APOE \u03b54-negative prodromal AD patients.\nWe therefore do not believe that the APOE \u03b54- dependent effects were biased by false positive AD diagnoses in the APOE \u03b54-negative group.",
      "Another limitation is that we relied on CSF pTau and total tau measurements.\nSince the associations between CSF tau measures and tau accumulation measured by tau PET imaging is only modest (Mattsson et al., 2017), and CSF tau is an overall measure which does not give any information about local tau pathology, it would be interesting to complement the current analysis with regional tau PET data in future studies.\nAlthough we examined many brain regions, we report nominal p-values, without adjustment for multiple testing, throughout the manuscript.",

      "The combination of NS1-specific antibodies with other antigens and tests may be necessary to increase the reliability of future seroprevalence studies [4].\nThe relevance of an adequate determination of the flaviviral serostatus is illustrated by the interaction between DENV and ZIKV antibodies that may both protect from and enhance subsequent infections [21, 25], and by the growing number of flaviviruses that cocirculate in Brazil, for which their potential immune interplay is largely unknown [16, 17].\nSince Brazil has licensed a DENV vaccine, adequate determination of the ZIKV serostatus and its potential interplay with DENV vaccination is crucial.",

      "The DENV titres in our patient group were higher than the ZIKV titres, even after secondary infection, as has been seen elsewhere [29,30], therefore if we are able to do the same study after ZIKV infection, or with well-defined cohorts studying both infections (e.g.\n[31,32]), it is conceivable that cut-off using ratios of the titres could be defined for population level exposure assessments for ZIKV and DENV in areas of co-transmission.\n"

      "Progression was defined depending on pre-treatment EDSS score: (1) increase \u2265 1.\n5 points at 24-months visit if pre-treatment EDSS = 0; (2) increase \u2265 1 point at 24-months visit if pre-treatment EDSS was \u2265 1 and \u2264 5; (3) increase \u2265 0.\n5 points at 24-months visit if pre-treatment EDSS was \u2265 5.5.",
      "Several of these antigens have structural or sequence similarities with epitopes of bacterial and viral antigens.\nThus, molecular mimicry is an appealing hypothesis for the origin of autoreactivities, with EBV and human herpes virus 6 proposed as viral candidates that mimic myelin proteins (27, 46, 47).\nNew bacterial candidates have been identified as molecular mimics relevant to MS from in-depth studies of the microbiome (48).",
      "A c c e p te d A r ti c le younger than 2 years [4, 5].\nAlthough the clinical manifestation of HHV-6A remains unclear, recent reports have suggested that it is associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) [6, 7] and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [8-10].\nThe reactivation of HHV-6 causes several diseases in immunocompromised patients and individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome [4, 11-13].",
      "Here we will refer to them as HHV-6 when citing studies where they have not been separated, and as such they occur in over 90% of the adult population and establish itself early in life (1).\nPrimary infection with HHV-6B generally occurs in infancy, when the protective maternal antibodies wane, and presents with a self-limiting undifferentiated febrile illness and in a portion with roseola infantum (2-4).\nAlthough there is less epidemiological data about HHV-6A, it seems to be more common in Africa and to have an asymptomatic primary infection (5).",

      "Consequently, reports of metabolic phenotypes of clinical isolates vary across studies and even within the same patient (Hocquet et al., 2016; Jorth et al., 2015; Rau et al., 2010).\nThere has recently been success using adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiments to study the evolution of antibiotic resistance in a controlled in vitro environment (Banerjee et al., 2017; Dragosits and Mattanovich, 2013; Furusawa et al., 2018; Jahn et al., 2017; Toprak et al., 2012; Yen and Papin, 2017; Zampieri et al., 2017).\nSequencing and expression profiling of lab-evolved resistant bacteria have revealed genetic mutations responsible for resistance phenotypes (La\u0301za\u0301r et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2014); however, connecting specific mutations to metabolic phenotypes remains a significant challenge (Palmer and Kishony, 2013; de Visser and Krug, 2014).",
      "Fungicide tolerance that among nodule bacteria is indeed an interesting feature which could be used to facilitate legume production in fungicide polluted soils.\nMechanistically, the fungicide detoxification is a complex physiological process which is controlled largely at genetic level (Jahn et al., 2017).\nAnd hence, the microorganisms that possess this property (fungicide tolerance) are likely to destruct/degrade fungicides and in effect may be used to remediate the contaminated soils (Sang et al., 2016).",
      "This approach permits precise dissection of bacteria adaptation to antimicrobials under highly controlled laboratory conditions and analysis of clinical pathogens in real-time rather than usual end-point.\nIt is reported that laboratory evolution of bacteria to different antimicrobials can decrease or enhance the sensitivity to multiple other antimicrobials agents, called cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity, respectively (Jahn et al., 2017).\nResearch demonstrated that alternating-drug therapy which depended on collateral sensitivity drug pairs can slow resistance evolution by constraining adaptive mutations towards resistance (Kim et al., 2014).",
      "The MFS (major facilitator superfamily) transporter is a superfamily 238 membrane transporter that promotes the movement of small solutes on the cell 239 membrane (Pao et al., 1998).\nMFS transporters can expel intracellular antibiotics into 240 the environment (Langton et al., 2005).\nIn the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 241 there are more than twenty MFS drug transporters that have positive regulatory effects 242 on commonly used antifungal drugs such as itraconazole, ketoconazole and 243 caspofungin (Costa et al., 2014)."

      "From an AMD-perspective, there is theoretical rationale to consider the systemic IL-6 as a potentially interesting disease contributor.\nIn the retina, microglial cells protect the retina through release and interaction with a range of cytokines and chemokines; however, when exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 for a prolonged amount of time, the microglial activity turn degenerative and promote the recruitment of circulating immune cells (Cuenca et al.\u00a02014; Arroba et al.\u00a02018; Rashid et al.\u00a02019).\nIn the endothelium, IL-6 activates the signal transducers and activators of transcription protein 3 (STAT3) signalling pathway as well as the release of chemokines such as interleukin-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the surface expression of adhesion proteins (Watson et al.",
      "The timing of TNF\u03b1 expression appears to be crucial as that the early induction of TNF\u03b1 correlates with RGC survival, while longer-term expression causes RGC degeneration (28).\nIn addition, reactive glial cells produce a variety of neuroprotective molecules, such as insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF1), to protect RGCs from neural damage (29).\nOverall, the available evidence strongly suggests that reactive glia are involved in the pathology of glaucoma.",
      "Microglial cells when activated in degenerative process may release different inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO), all of them contributing to the maintenance of a chronic neuroinflammatory environment that initially plays essential role in protecting retinal tissue during the early steps of its degeneration (Cuenca et al., 2014).\nHowever, continuous presence of proinflammatory stimuli induces locally the cellular damage which together with retinal drusen can subsequently attract other reactive systemic immune cells to the retina (Arroba et al., 2018).\nIn case of prolonged insult to the retina, the overreactive neurotoxic microglia release large amounts of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic factors such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, creating a proinflammatory environment favorable for further recruitment of retinal microglia and exogenous infiltrating monocytes (Scholz et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2015).",

      "(c) Functions of the cerebrospinal fluid flow The differential nature of the bulk flow and the near-wall flow suggests these different levels of CSF flow may serve different means of relaying signalling and developmental cues.\nIt is likely that the bulk mid-ventricular flow supports brain homeostasis and volume transmission, which is the long-range, intercellular communication [166,167].\nTransfer of neuropeptides across brain ventricles was shown to not only promote basic physiological needs like hunger [168], but also increase neuronal excitability to enhance cortical alertness in response to acute stress [150].",

      "Also, we believe that the increase of activity we describe in our study is most likely a general phenomenon and should be considered as a basic difference to aCSF that lacks many major components of the hCSF.\nArguments for this are the general overall increase observed in two distinct areas of the brain (cortex and hippocampus) and the results of previous studies in distinct species, showing all in general an increase of the neuronal activity (Bjorefeldt et al., 2018).\nWhile there might be distinct actions of several components, also reducing neuronal activity levels, we believe that the sum effect of hCSF versus aCSF leads to increasing the activity of the network probably by several stimulatory effects.",
      "Using standardized methods and solutions is a key factor for enabling such comparisons; as recently pointed out by de la Prida and Huberfeld (2019), aCSF is as such a standardized solution.\nThe results of the present study and others (Perez-Alcazar et al., 2016; Bjorefeldt et al., 2018; Forsberg et al., 2018) show a clear difference in the neuronal firing behavior when comparing aCSF and hCSF.\nTo understand mechanisms during both physiological and pathological activity within the human brain network, it is crucial to mimic the environment in the brain as closely as experimentally possible."

      "The scalp electrodemontages employed in the current study also did not cover the whole scalp and it is plausible that the non-zero potentials across the channels were subtracted from true potential leading to a reduction in the MMN amplitude for AVG and REST referencing procedures across the three channel montages compared to LM reference.\nGiven that we used a threelayered spherical model for the REST approach, the EEG data referenced with REST may show a better MMN reconstruction than AVE referencing for low density electrode montages such as used in the current study (Chella et al., 2017).\nThis could be a possible explanation for larger MMN amplitude when computed after REST referencing than AVG referencing."

      "\nThe effect of mitochondrial dysfunction on sarcoplasmic Ca content during alternans has been studied by our group(32) and others (33).\nThese studies have provided insight on the changes that occur in Ca handling in myocytes in diseased hearts and may open the door to novel therapeutic interventions.",

      "Thus, it would become an appropriate approach to abolish arsenic mediated reproductive hazards and other health hazards by enhancing intracellular antioxidant capacity (Maiti et al., 2012).\nDespite the minimum scientific confirmation, dietary NAC supplementation can defend against toxins and environmental pollutants and also enhance the level of essential sex hormone testosterone in men (\u0160alamon et al., 2019).\nN-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a thiol containing antioxidant that increases the intracellular stores of glutathione in the way of establishing its hepatoprotective activity (Nissar et al., 2013).",

      "Previously, one of the challenges with doing -omics studies in wild populations was dearth of reference genomes, where the few reference genomes available were from distantly related species.\nReference genomes are becoming easier to assemble, and, although long-read and linked-read sequencing technologies are still in their infancy in their application to birds, they have made the production of high-quality reference genomes for a variety of species much more practical (Gordon et al.\u00a02016; O\u2019Connor et al.\u00a02019).\nStill, comparative transcriptome studies without reference genomes have proven their worth by revealing a variety of exciting new leads for the study of the molecular basis of sociality in animals.",
      "Despite rapid development of sequencing methodology over the past decades, genotyping MHC in non-model vertebrate species is still challenging, primarily because of numerous duplications (paralogs).\nToday, third-generation sequencing that generates long reads offers a promising advancement in resolving MHC architecture in larger spectrum of taxa [31], but genomic organization of the MHC region has so far been well characterized for just a few vertebrate species, mostly those with a low number of duplicated loci.\nThis scarcity of data has long hampered comparative analyses of MHC organization, but recently, with the advent of second-generation sequencing, estimates of MHC copy number have started to accumulate [20].",
      "This suggests that having more MHC-I alleles may sufficiently increase the repertoire of antigens recognized in species inhabiting wetter regions.\nHowever, in order to understand fully how variation in the amino acid motif of the PBR affects the range of antigens bound byMHCmolecules, further work is required to better understand the structure of MHC molecules in birds beyond chickens [65].\nDespite the strong effects of precipitation on the MHC-I diversity of African resident species, the MHC-I diversity of migrant species appeared to be independent of climatic conditions."

      "Patient-specific models were used to predict specific deficiencies and suggest dietary changes that could be implemented to compensate [54].\nWhile the gut microbiome is one of the most studied of the human microbiomes, other studies have focused on various impacts of bacterial interactions with humans [47 ,50 ,55] and there are other human microbiome sites that are clinically important such as oral, skin and vagina [56], oral microbiome [57], skin microbiome [58], and vaginal microbiome [59].\nTherapeutics While the use of GEMs to study cancer can be used to gain better insight into metabolic and functional attributes of cancerous cells, ultimately there is a desire to utilize the knowledge to improve cancer treatments.",
      "Implementation of such approaches has enabled the design of probiotic cocktails either to outcompete pathogens [49] or to reduce immune activation [50 ].\nFinally, metabolic information can be used for genome-scale metabolic modeling (GSMM) and flux balance analysis [36,51] (Figure 1c).\nThese tools predict and provide the cross-feeding and competition mechanisms necessary, but not sufficient, to design a multi-strain formulation [36,52,53], and allows designing the optimal bacterial community for a desired metabolite, for example butyrate production [54], and predict the growth medium for commensal species [55 ].",
      "Often, biologic fluids, such as blood and urine, are used as metabolomic samples to have the perception of circulatory and excretory metabolites in health and disease (Mardinoglu et al., 2018a).\nIn the field of human microbiota, metabolomics can additionally be performed using stool samples in order to have information on the microbial-metabolite consumption and production contributing to the human metabolism (Sen and Oresic, 2019).\nDifferent \u2018omics data will give different biologic information.",
      "Different \u2018omics data will give different biologic information.\nThis biologic insight can be integrated to allow the analysis of molecular mechanisms composing complex networks, which are representative of biological systems (Mardinoglu et al., 2018a; Sen and Oresic, 2019).\nDue to its functional involvement in the production of essential bioactive metabolites (Dalile et al., 2019), regulation of immune triggers (Hooper et al., 2012; Fung et al., 2017; Tilg et al., 2020) and host-energy homeostasis (Tremaroli and Backhed, 2012), the human microbiome has been compared to a vital organ of the human organism (Dalile et al., 2019).",

      "The availability of EO information can support public engagement processes, such as in the siting of new renewable energy development projects (Hindmarsh and Matthews, 2008).\nSimilarly, EO tools can also serve to provide stakeholders such as potential project developers or funders, grid operators, or national or private scale transmission entities, with renewable energy studies that take into account site-specific, seasonal variability forecasts for improved financial analyses (Kosmopoulos et al., 2018).\nGovernance and public engagement can also be improved with greater understanding of human and physical environments or geography through EOs of appropriate resolution (Butler et al., 2011).",
      "Aerosols absorb and scatter solar radiation; however, these mechanisms still remain a major source of uncertainty in climate modelling [5].\nAdditionally, aerosol estimation is important for diverse applications such as in the correction of the surface\u2019s satellite retrievals [6\u20138] and in forecasting solar energy [9,10].\nOver the last two decades, significant improvements have been performed for surface networks and the satellite retrievals of aerosols, contributing to major improvements in the monitoring and understanding of the related procedures.",
      "Contribution 9 of this Special Issue is one example; it deals with the methods for nowcasting solar irradiance using Meteosat Second Generation images [15].\nThe next contribution, paper 10, focuses on forecasting aerosols using remote sensing and its impact on solar energy plants performance in sites with high aerosol loading climatology [16].\nFinally, the last contribution of this Special Issue is aimed at studying solar radiation variability at different temporal scales and the connection with satellite-derived cloud properties using GOES images [17].",

      "The coefficient of correlation (R) for the CAMS-MACC AOD was 0.38 and for INSAT-3D AOD was 0.25, whereas the corresponding correlation for the irradiance obtained from INSIOS was significantly improved, reaching 0.9991 and 0.9997 for GHI and 0.9959 and 0.9980 for DNI for CAMS-MACC AOD and INSAT-3D AOD, respectively.\nThis shows that the measured AOD differences between CAMS and INSAT-3D affect the SR minutely [53].\nSuch data behavior shows that the effect of AOD absolute differences in India in SR estimation is less than 1%, as discussed in various similar comparison approaches in [84,92,95].",
      "Knowing that McClear is a widely used model and used by SoDa services for SR estimations in Europe, Africa, and South America, one may have an interest in INSIOS for solar energy applications in other parts of the world.\nImplementations of SENSE to Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East support regional energy planning and management through various solar energy applications [53,100].\nINSIOS is going to be utilized for renewable energy management in India at various scales (from big solar farms to rooftop installations), exploiting the local earth observation capabilities (e.g., INSAT-3D).",
      "For the simulation procedure, we firstly estimated the surface solar radiation reaching the PV panels on the horizontal plane [34].\nThen, we made the transformations as to simulate the radiation at the tilted plane and finally we performed the conversions to reproduce the real PV energy production [37].\nAs a result, based on the simulation outputs, we compared the simulations with the real radiation and PV energy production values.",

      "Over the past 50 years, remote sensing has shifted the field away from the reliance on traditional site-based measurements and enabled observations and estimates of key drought-related variables over larger spatial and temporal scales than was previously possible.\nNowadays, using satellite-based remote sensing in combination with in situ data is a promising approach for informing Earth surface modeling [20].\nA recent review [21] charts the rise of remote sensing for drought monitoring, examining key milestones and technologies for assessing meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological drought events.",
      "Given the limitation of ground measurements, satellite data could be used in soil moisture\u2013temperature coupling studies from an observational point of view, and the recent development of soil moisture and evapotranspiration products from remote sensing technology provides the possibility for such studies.\nA wide variety of datasets makes it possible for us to study soil moisture\u2013temperature coupling from an observational perspective [24,27,28].\nThis study utilized one of these satellite-based datasets with a coupling diagnostic to show the spatial distribution and interannual variation of strong coupling regimes between soil moisture and temperature over China in different seasons.",
      "One way of improving the SM state is through data assimilation (DA); this approach combines information from satellite observations with model data, using a mathematical framework, see, for example, [7\u201314].\nMicrowave satellite instruments allow us to monitor and map SM at the global scale, and provide a wealth of information that can be used to inform and improve Earth surface modelling [15].\nHowever, satellite remote sensing of SM has limitations because of spatial and temporal gaps in the resulting data product.",

      "The RdRp of coronaviruses is a well-established drug target; the active site of the RdRp is highly conserved among positive-sense RNA viruses (te Velthuis 2014).\nThese RdRps have low fidelity (Selisko et al.\u00a02018), allowing them to recognize a variety of modified nucleotide analogues as substrates.\nSuch nucleotide analogues may inhibit further RNA-polymerase catalyzed RNA replication making them important candidate anti-viral agents (McKenna et al.",
      "In contrast, residues involved in nucleotide reorientation at the tunnel entry are not detectably conserved when considering all RdRp of (+)ssRNA viruses.\nFor instance, the segment between motifs F1 and F3 is of very varying length between virus families (from 5 to >50 residues) and the entry loop at its tip that harbors motif F2 is highly mobile (35), rendering both sequence-only and structure-based alignments dubious.\nHowever, in this third circle residues are conserved within virus families, whether they participate in triphosphate or base stabilisation in our simulations.",
      "Thus at the tunnel entry motif F2 (including K151), R48 and K51 are strictly conserved in all genotypes of HCV and in its closest relatives.\nMotif D on the other side of the tunnel from motif F2 also displays this pattern of conservation within families, for instance in flaviviruses and enteroviruses (35).\nIn enterovirus RdRp a lysine from motif D (not present in HCV NS5B) could serve in reorientation of the nucleotide.",
      "While the substrate affinity in RdRPs during elongation is severalfold lower than what is observed in DNA polymerases, the preference for rNTPs remains thousands of times separated from dNTPs (133, 134).\nPreference for rNTPs is further enhanced intracellularly due to the high rNTP/dNTP ratio (105, 135, 136).\nInfluenza virus RdRP kinetics Influenza A virus (IAV) contains a single-stranded, fragmented RNA genome of negative-sense polarity.",
      "As a result of the structural biology revolution of the 1980s \u2013 1990s our understanding of enzyme 'specificity' is reasonably mature.\nWe have learned how enzymes from many structural families can recognize specific substrates with great selectivity compared to close structural substrate analogs, by straightforward exploitation of shape, charge, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding complementarity [19-25].\nAlso, as described in article by Tawfik and Gruic-Solvulj in this issue, nature has also exploited mechanisms to explicitly select against noncognate substrates.",
      "\nThis article does not extensively reference individual structures and/or conclusions made from them, and does not discuss the functions of the conserved motifs in great detail, but the accompanying review by Selisko et al.\u00a0[1] in this issue of Viruses nicely describes this in the context of flaviviral RdRPs.\nRather, this article describes the method underlying a comprehensive superpositioning of viral polymerases yielding a set of 646 structures from 414 different protein data bank (PDB) entries released up until 30 June 2019."

      "A similar approach, i.e., engraftment of allogeneic NK cells, could be clinically relevant to treat patients infected with flavivirus, which includes viruses such as West Nile, yellow fever, dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya.\nFlavivirus-induced diseases are currently generating major health problems and, interestingly, NK cells play a central role in controlling these viruses (75).\nIn other deadly viral infection such as Ebola, which also decreases peripheral NK cell numbers, the transplant of NK cells could Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5 January 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 3026 be inefficient because Ebola virus uses specific NK evasion mechanism (76) and can modulate NK function to increase viral pathogenicity (77).",
      "CD8+T cells have been shown to be critical to viral clearance from CNS in other models, but mice lacking T and B cells showed similar survival profiles as the B6-WT mice.\nSimilarly, NK cells, which mediate clearance of several flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, zika, and dengue virus (40) were present in the infected CNS as demonstrated by the increased expression klrK1, granzyme A and B, IL12b and SelE and SelL.\nHowever, depletion of NK cells did not result in a marked acceleration of the disease course, which indicates that multiple overlapping immune responses underly the response to SINV in healthy mice."

      "AI, defined by AI = AOD\u00d7AE, is a product that weights AOD by particle size and is considered as a suitable proxy for aerosol number concentration and thus CCN (Nakajima et al., 2001).\nSome recent studies (e.g., Li et al., 2018; McCoy et al., 2018) have examined trends in CDNC based on satellite observations, but the observed trends of CDNC are explained using aerosol derived from reanalysis data only and have not examined synergistic trends of CDNC and aerosol properties from satellite observations.\nHere, we examine the synergistic trends in aerosol and cloud properties derived from both satellite observations.",
      "This enables us to robustly quantify and then constrain the uncertainty in the change in Nd and RFaci.\nThe Nd derived from satellite retrievals has been shown to be reasonably unbiased in comparison with aircraft measurements (21, 24\u201328) and to agree well in both the remote Southern Ocean (SO) (29) and the NH (28).\nBiases between in situ and Nd calculated based on Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are on the order of 1 cm\u22123 to 20 cm\u22123, depending on geographic region and boundary layer stratification, and systematic bias does not scale strongly with Nd (27\u201329).",

      "The hemispheric constraint depends on the accuracy of the satellite-derived values of PD Nd.\nAs noted in the Introduction, MODIS Nd has been extensively validated against aircraft measurements in the NH and parts of the SH (21, 28, 29).\nBecause aircraft observations of Nd are not as plentiful in the more remote regions of the SO, we use other datasets to provide additional assessment of the quality and the believability of the surprising SO MODIS Nd pattern (Fig.",

      "\nFor EUS and WEU regions, negative trends in CDNC and AOD are consistent with previous studies (Bennartz & Rausch, 2017; Li et al., 2018; Mao et al., 2014; Pozzer et al., 2015; Yoon et al., 2014; Zhao et al.\u00a0, 2017) and are closely related to a persistent decline in air pollutant emissions in the eastern United States and Western Europe (Krotkov et al., 2016; McCoy et al., 2018; Pozzer et al., 2015; Xing et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2017).\nFor annual time series of aerosol properties over EC (Figure 3), we find a peak value in 2005 rather than 2007 when a turning point is found from recent studies (Alfaro\u2010Contreras et al., 2017; de Leeuw et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017).",

      "Soil\u2010derived bVOCs impact tropospheric chemistry and also play important roles in plant\u2010microbe signaling and microbe\u2010microbe signaling, with consequences for plant productivity and ecosystem functioning (Carslaw et al., 2010; Laothawornkitkul et al., 2009; Pinto et al., 2007).\nSoil bVOCs are synthesized and emitted by plant roots and soil microorganisms involved in the breakdown of soil organic matter (Albers et al., 2018; Isidorov & Jdanova, 2002; Leff & Fierer, 2008; Rasmann & Agrawal, 2008; Steeghs et al., 2004; Tsuruta et al., 2018).\nFor example, rhizosphere\u2010derived bVOCs can serve as chemoattractants for rhizobacteria, which can in turn promote plant growth and increase resistance to stress (for reviews see Massalha et al.",
      "The major biotic sources contributing to the sBVOC pool are roots and microorganisms, while abiotic sources include volatilization of BVOCs from plant litter or soil solution (Pe\u00f1uelas et al., 2014), along with desorption from soil organic matter (SOM) or soil minerals (Breus and Mishchenko, 2006).\nBiotic sinks of sBVOCs are primarily microbes that use BVOCs as a carbon and energy source (Albers et al., 2018; Kramsh\u00f8j et al., 2018).\nAbiotic sinks include sorption to soil minerals or SOM and dissolution in soil water (Breus and Mishchenko, 2006) as well as abiotic degradation processes (Insam and Seewald, 2010).",
      "In addition to supporting differences in production and release of BVOCs, the influence of different plant species on soil microbial communities and soil conditions may also affect microbial mineralization of sBVOCs.\nArctic soil microbes have been shown to completely mineralize various BVOCs (Albers et al., 2018).\nThis sBVOC uptake process appears to be so efficient, that the large release of BVOCs from thawing permafrost was almost completely hindered when the BVOCs needed to pass the active layer soil of arctic tundra before release to the atmosphere (Kramsh\u00f8j et al., 2018).",
      "The observed negative correlation between SOM and sBVOC concentrations might be linked to higher sorption of sBVOCs in soils with a high SOM content during periods of net BVOC production in the soil (Breus and Mishchenko, 2006).\nAnother possible explanation for this relationship could be higher microbial consumption of sBVOCs in soils with high SOM content (Albers et al., 2018).\nApart from the spatial differences in the sBVOC concentrations, temporal differences were also evident.",
      "One reason for this is the simple fact that the vast majority of soil microorganisms cannot be cultured with current cultivation techniques (Vartoukian et al., 2010; Chaudhary et al., 2019).\nSoil microbial communities readily mineralize VOCs and mineralization rates, and capacity, seem to be optimized to follow the VOC blends in their particular environment (Albers et al., 2018).\nFor example, the microbial uptake of isoprene (Cleveland & Yavitt, 1997; Cleveland & Yavitt, 1998; Gray et al., 2015) could be highest in soils from ecosystems with strong isoprene-emitters.",
      "Indeed, it is well known that methanol-oxidizing bacteria, from a range of phylogenetic groups, are widely present in soils (Kolb, 2009; Stacheter et al., 2013).\nRecently, it was shown that complete methanol degradation to CO2 in soil may be very fast at environmental methanol concentrations (Albers et al., 2018).\nWhat actually influences methanol degradation capacity in soil is, on the other hand, not well-known.",
      "Soil and litter microbes can also modify VOC emissions by metabolizing plant-emitted VOCs [26], which may cause low isoprenoid fluxes measured from soil with dense understorey vegetation cover [15].\nSome understorey vegetation (grasses, shrubs, mosses, lichens, and other vegetation) [13,14] can also contribute to the exchange of BVOCs by emitting them [7].\nGround level emissions to the atmosphere are often 1\u20132 orders of magnitude lower than those from aboveground vegetation [10].",
      "Soils are considered to be sources and sinks of BVOCs [8,10,12,22] with very low exchanges in Mediterranean-type ecosystems [17,29,30].\nMaybe microbial processes play most important roles in atmosphere-soil exchanges of BVOCs [7,12,19].\nIn this line, there are studies showing the lower VOC emission rates in the litter plus soil treatments indicating many litter VOCs appear to be metabolized in soil [8,12,22], meanwhile, litter VOCs represent an important carbon source to soil and elevate soil microbial activity [22].",

      "The FLUXCOM relies on a Water-Availability Index (WAI), which was calculated from the ERA5 fields at 0.25\u00b0 latitude/ longitude spatial resolution at daily time-steps.\nThe FLUXCOM dataset has been evaluated against sitelevel data [22] and independent estimates of global carbon fluxes [23].\nFLUXCOM is known to show weak performance in estimating inter-annual variability in in situ carbon fluxes [22], and to systematically underestimate the magnitude of royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil.Trans.R.Soc.B 375:20190507 3 variability [23].",
      "Therefore, to reduce the influence of different soil schemes in SManom, standardized anomalies in SM from ERA5 and from DGVMs were used.\nThe FLUXCOM dataset produced for this study shows too weak variance of anomalies in gross and net carbon fluxes, which is a known issue with this product [23].\nThe DGVMs also show considerable differences in the inter-annual variability amplitudes.",
      "The DGVMs also show considerable differences in the inter-annual variability amplitudes.\nTherefore, we analysed standardized anomalies in GPP, TER and NEP as in other studies based on this dataset [23].\nAs different datasets from FLUXCOM are available, they can provide a data-driven estimate of anomalies in carbon fluxes and their spread to compare with those simulated by DGVMs.",
      "Even though the multiple linear regression controls for correlation between variables, the strong correlation between T and SM adds uncertainty to the sensitivity estimates.\nThe SM data used to estimate DGVM sensitivities were the simulated SM fields, while for FLUXCOM, the WAI [23] was used.\nWe use the six runs from FLUXCOM as observation-based reference.",
      "This might be because DGVMs do not simulate well drought-induced mortality, or because they underestimate soil organic carbon and consequently TER in the high latitudes.\nHowever, the disagreement might also be because FLUXCOM lacks information about carry-over effects from the previous spring warming, or because of its known limited performance in simulating inter-annual variability [22,23].\nTo assess the skill of both DGVMs and FLUXCOM in estimating the DH2018 anomalies in carbon fluxes, we compared their estimates of NEP and GPP with those of a compilation of 52 eddy covariance (EC) sites [41].",
      "Thus, improved understanding of GHG fluxes at regional scales can improve our understanding of the processes controlling them.\nRegional-scale fluxes can be determined using bottom-up approaches by upscaling the eddy covariance measurements of the Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) using meteorological and remote sensing data, such as those used in the FLUXCOM [11].\nAs mentioned earlier, another bottom-up approach is the use of process-based terrestrial biosphere models to determine GHG fluxes within a given area.",

      "Similarly, mutations in the H3K9 methyltransferase, met-2, or the H3K4me2 demethylase, spr-5, also result in transgenerational sterility phenotypes (47\u201351).\nFurthermore, disruption of the H3K27 methylation status within germ cells permits conversion of the germ cells into different somatic cell lineages (3,6,7).\nThis similarity in fertility defects between mutants of the chromatin and RNAi pathways suggests that the intersection of these pathways may play a role in the maintenance of fertility and totipotency, particularly during heat stress.",
      "The Notch receptor GLP-1 maintains the germ stem cell niche and mutants with a gain-of-function mutation for glp-1(gof) have elevated Notch signaling in their germline [24].\nIn combination with lin-53 RNAi, glp-1(gof) mutants show a striking enhancement of germ cell reprogramming to neurons upon TF overexpression [23].\nTranscriptome analysis of dissected gonads revealed that elevated Notch signaling activates PRC2-silenced genes, including expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1.",
      "\nAmong these proteins, SOD-5 is expressed in neurons (Doonan et al.\u00a0, 2008), and GAS-1 is expressed in gonad, neurons, and muscle (Kayser et al., 2001; Seelk et al., 2016).\nWe investigated the effect of simulated microgravity treatment on intestinal expressions of other genes.",
      "\nFurther investigation of germ cell fate safeguarding by LIN-53 and PRC2 revealed that conversion to neurons is strongly enhanced in animals with increased germline Notch signaling [23].\nThe Notch receptor GLP-1 maintains the germ stem cell niche and mutants with a gain-of-function mutation for glp-1(gof) have elevated Notch signaling in their germline [24].",

      "For 51 example, OppA from L. lactis binds preferentially proline-rich peptides containing at least 52 one isoleucine [11].\nThe binding of the peptides causes a conformational change shifting the 53 SBPs from an open state to a closed state able to interact with its cognate membrane complex 54 to translocate and deliver the peptides within the bacterial cell [12, 13].\n55 Peptides are used by Gram-positive bacteria to sense environmental changes and to 56 adapt their behavior accordingly.",

      "We hypothesized that D-cysteine binds at the same site as Lcysteine or L-cystine, but that binding of Dcysteine induces a distinct conformational change that does not lead to increased thermostability.\nRecent studies have indeed demonstrated that binding of closely related substrates by SBPs can lead to different bound conformations (17, 60, 61).\nTo explore this possibility, we conducted binding competition experiments using by guest on M arch 13, 2020 http://w w w .jbc.org/ D ow nloaded from nanoDSF.",

      "\nDe Boer et al., showed that the degree of closing 3 observed in the absence of ligand was indeed identical to that of the ligand-bound 4 conformation for both the mutant and wild type [52].\nInterestingly, the MalFGK2 ATPase 5 activity seen with both wild type MalE and A96W/I329W MalE in the absence of maltose 6 were similar, but only wild type MalE resulted in a large stimulation of activity upon addition 7 of maltose [55].",
      "\n24 24 These observations are consistent with recent smFRET studies that show that the 1 ATPase activity of the transporter was dependent on the propensity of substrate-bound MalE 2 to adopt one of several closed conformations [52].\nOnly closed MalE conformations (Fig.",
