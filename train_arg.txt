__label__1 The 5-year overall mortality for short-term and long-term suppression was 19.0% and 15.2%, respectively; the observed hazard ratio was 1.42 (upper 95.71% confidence limit, 1.79; P=0.65 for noninferiority).
__label__0 Therefore, oxidative modifications of this cysteine could contribute to GFAP disruption or aggregation in pathological situations associated with oxidative or electrophilic stress.
__label__0 Stable isotopically labeled aripiprazole, aripiprazole-D8, has been used as the internal standard (IS) for both analytes.
__label__0 Blood in the cardiac cavities is modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) scheme.
__label__0 Instead, SBPs sample a range of conformations that activate transport.
__label__0 Methods: Based on 60,706 human exomes from the ExAC dataset, we performed an in-depth computational analysis of the prevalence of functional variants in 806 drug-related genes, including 628 known drug targets.
__label__0 Participants: Over a three-month period, the questionnaire was administered to 263 black diabetes mellitus outpatients (174 women and 89 men), aged between 16 and 89 years.
__label__1 Using Mann-Whitney U tests, patients in music therapy group showed significantly lower numerical pain score at 60min (p=0.045) whereas there was no significant difference between the two groups at all time points for anxiety scores (p>0.05).
__label__0 Methods: We have used a highly parallelized computational solver to test different fiber models of ventricular muscular connectivity.
